__The knowledge of cloned rice genes lost in the information of rice functional genomics studies__

## Introdution
More than 2500 cloned rice genes and 310 gene families comprised of 3691 genes were collected. For each gene, 
various information concerning the gene symbol, the genomic locus in the Nipponbare reference genome, 
the Genbank accession number, the title, journal, year, author affiliation, abstract of related 
publications and the text mining result of the publications were provided.

    
## How to query this database?

This database was designed as a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) application and was deployed in the Cloud. 
You can query this database [HERE](http://ricencode.ncpgr.cn).
You can query this database using the genomic locus assigned by the [Rice Genome Annotation Project](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/), 
or the genomic locus assigned by the [Rice Annotation Project](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/), or the gene symbol. 
You can retrieve the basic information of a gene, the publications on a gene, the agronomic traits associated with a gene, the connections between genes from this database.


## How to contribute to this database?

You can also contribute to this database by submitting information on newly cloned rice gene or new publications to this database using this [system](http://ricencode.ncpgr.cn).
