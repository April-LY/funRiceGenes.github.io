* **Publication**  
    + [SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.%5BTitle%5D), 2018, New Phytol.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Together, our results show that the transcription factor SIP1 interacts with OxTrx1, allowing OsTrx1 to specifically target Ehd1, altering H3K4me3 levels, increasing Ehd1 expression and thereby promoting flowering
    + Mutations in SIP1 led to a late heading date under long-day and short-day conditions
    + SIP1 participates in regulation of flowering time in rice by recruiting OsTrx1 to Ehd1.
