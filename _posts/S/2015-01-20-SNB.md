10. __OsIDS1__, __SNB__, [Rice miR172 induces flowering by suppressing OsIDS1 and SNB, two AP2 genes that negatively regulate expression of Ehd1 and florigens.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice miR172 induces flowering by suppressing OsIDS1 and SNB, two AP2 genes that negatively regulate expression of Ehd1 and florigens.%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of those AP2 genes delayed flowering; overexpression of miR172-resistant forms of SNB or OsIDS1 further delayed this process
11. __OsIDS1__, __SNB__, [Rice miR172 induces flowering by suppressing OsIDS1 and SNB, two AP2 genes that negatively regulate expression of Ehd1 and florigens.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice miR172 induces flowering by suppressing OsIDS1 and SNB, two AP2 genes that negatively regulate expression of Ehd1 and florigens.%5BTitle%5D)),  In phytochrome mutants, miR172d levels were increased whereas those of SNB and OsIDS1 were decreased
12. __OsIDS1__, __SNB__, [Rice miR172 induces flowering by suppressing OsIDS1 and SNB, two AP2 genes that negatively regulate expression of Ehd1 and florigens.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice miR172 induces flowering by suppressing OsIDS1 and SNB, two AP2 genes that negatively regulate expression of Ehd1 and florigens.%5BTitle%5D)), We revealed that miR172d developmentally induced flowering via repressing OsIDS1 and SNB, which suppressed Ehd1
