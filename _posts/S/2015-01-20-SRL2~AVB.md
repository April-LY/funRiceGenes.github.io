* **Key message**  
    + Here, we describe a srl2 (semi-rolled leaf2) rice mutant, which has incurved leaves due to the presence of defective sclerenchymatous cells on the abaxial side of the leaf and displays narrow leaves and reduced plant height
    + SRL2 was mainly expressed in the vascular bundles of leaf blades, leaf sheaths, and roots, especially in their sclerenchymatous cells
    + The transcriptional activities of several leaf development-related YABBY genes were significantly altered in the srl2 mutant
    + Double mutant analysis suggested that SRL2 and SHALLOT-LIKE1 (SLL1)/ROLLED LEAF9 (RL9) function in distinct pathways that regulate abaxial-side leaf development
    + Hence, SRL2 plays an important role in regulating leaf development, particularly during sclerenchymatous cell differentiation
    + Map-based cloning revealed that SRL2 encodes a novel plant-specific protein of unknown biochemical function
    + RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that the development process was affected in avb
    + Our research shows that AVB is involved in the maintenance of the normal cell division pattern in lateral primordia development and that the AVB gene is required for procambium establishment following auxin signaling
    + Map-based cloning and genetic complementation demonstrated that AVB encodes a land plant conserved protein with unknown functions
    + Ploidy analysis and the inÂ situ expression patterns of histone H4 confirmed that cell proliferation was impaired during lateral primordia development, whereas procambium cells showed a greater ability to undergo cell division in avb
