## Key message
1. __leaf__, [Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we describe a srl2 (semi-rolled leaf2) rice mutant, which has incurved leaves due to the presence of defective sclerenchymatous cells on the abaxial side of the leaf and displays narrow leaves and reduced plant height
2. __leaf__, [Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.%5BTitle%5D)),  SRL2 was mainly expressed in the vascular bundles of leaf blades, leaf sheaths, and roots, especially in their sclerenchymatous cells
3. __leaf__, [Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.%5BTitle%5D)),  The transcriptional activities of several leaf development-related YABBY genes were significantly altered in the srl2 mutant
4. __leaf__, [Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.%5BTitle%5D)),  Double mutant analysis suggested that SRL2 and SHALLOT-LIKE1 (SLL1)/ROLLED LEAF9 (RL9) function in distinct pathways that regulate abaxial-side leaf development
5. __leaf__, [Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.%5BTitle%5D)),  Hence, SRL2 plays an important role in regulating leaf development, particularly during sclerenchymatous cell differentiation
6. __vascular bundle__, [Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.%5BTitle%5D)),  SRL2 was mainly expressed in the vascular bundles of leaf blades, leaf sheaths, and roots, especially in their sclerenchymatous cells
7. __leaf development__, [Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.%5BTitle%5D)),  The transcriptional activities of several leaf development-related YABBY genes were significantly altered in the srl2 mutant

10. __development__, [Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.%5BTitle%5D)),  Double mutant analysis suggested that SRL2 and SHALLOT-LIKE1 (SLL1)/ROLLED LEAF9 (RL9) function in distinct pathways that regulate abaxial-side leaf development
11. __map-based cloning__, [Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.%5BTitle%5D)),  Map-based cloning revealed that SRL2 encodes a novel plant-specific protein of unknown biochemical function
12. __height__, [Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we describe a srl2 (semi-rolled leaf2) rice mutant, which has incurved leaves due to the presence of defective sclerenchymatous cells on the abaxial side of the leaf and displays narrow leaves and reduced plant height
13. __plant height__, [Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we describe a srl2 (semi-rolled leaf2) rice mutant, which has incurved leaves due to the presence of defective sclerenchymatous cells on the abaxial side of the leaf and displays narrow leaves and reduced plant height
