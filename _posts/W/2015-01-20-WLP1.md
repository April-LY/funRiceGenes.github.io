## Key message
1. __photosynthesis__, [The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions%5BTitle%5D),  The transcription pattern of a number of genes involved in plastidial transcription/translation and in photosynthesis was altered in the wlp1 mutants
2. __chloroplast__, [The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions%5BTitle%5D),  The WLP1 protein localized to the chloroplast
3. __chloroplast__, [The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions%5BTitle%5D),  These results reveal that WLP1 is required for normal chloroplast development, especially under low temperature conditions
4. __chloroplast__, [The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions%5BTitle%5D), The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions
5. __panicle__, [The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions%5BTitle%5D),  Here we describe a rice mutant named wlp1 white leaf and panicles 1 selected from a population of tissue culture regenerants
6. __leaf__, [The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions%5BTitle%5D),  Here we describe a rice mutant named wlp1 white leaf and panicles 1 selected from a population of tissue culture regenerants
7. __seedling__, [The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions%5BTitle%5D),  WLP1 was mainly transcribed in green tissues and particularly abundantly in the early seedling leaves
8. __temperature__, [The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions%5BTitle%5D), " In addition, the expression level of WLP1 was induced by the low temperature
9. __temperature__, [The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions%5BTitle%5D),  These results reveal that WLP1 is required for normal chloroplast development, especially under low temperature conditions
