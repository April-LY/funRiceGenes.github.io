    + __WOX11__, __WOX6__, [A Core Regulatory Pathway Controlling Rice Tiller Angle Mediated by the LAZY1-dependent Asymmetric Distribution of Auxin.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A Core Regulatory Pathway Controlling Rice Tiller Angle Mediated by the LAZY1-dependent Asymmetric Distribution of Auxin.%5BTitle%5D),  We also show that two functionally redundant transcription factor genes, WUSCHEL RELATED HOMEOBOX6 (WOX6) and WOX11, are expressed asymmetrically in response to auxin to connect gravitropism responses with the control of rice tiller angle
