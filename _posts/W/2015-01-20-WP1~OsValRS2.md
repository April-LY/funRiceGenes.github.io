## Key message
1. __chloroplast__, [WHITE PANICLE1, a Val-tRNA synthetase regulating chloroplast ribosome biogenesis in rice, is essential for early chloroplast development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WHITE PANICLE1, a Val-tRNA synthetase regulating chloroplast ribosome biogenesis in rice, is essential for early chloroplast development.%5BTitle%5D)),  Chlorophyll autofluorescence observations and transmission electron microscopy analyses indicated that wp1 mutants are defective in early chloroplast development
2. __chloroplast__, [WHITE PANICLE1, a Val-tRNA synthetase regulating chloroplast ribosome biogenesis in rice, is essential for early chloroplast development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WHITE PANICLE1, a Val-tRNA synthetase regulating chloroplast ribosome biogenesis in rice, is essential for early chloroplast development.%5BTitle%5D)),  Western blot analyses of chloroplast-encoded proteins showed that wp1 mutants were defective in chloroplast protein synthesis, although transcription of some genes was higher in wp1 than in wild type
3. __chloroplast__, [WHITE PANICLE1, a Val-tRNA synthetase regulating chloroplast ribosome biogenesis in rice, is essential for early chloroplast development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WHITE PANICLE1, a Val-tRNA synthetase regulating chloroplast ribosome biogenesis in rice, is essential for early chloroplast development.%5BTitle%5D)),  We found that wp1 was impaired in chloroplast ribosome biogenesis
