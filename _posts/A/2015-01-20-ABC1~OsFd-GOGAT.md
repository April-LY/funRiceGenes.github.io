* **Key message**  
    + Metabolomics analysis revealed the accumulation of excessive amount of amino acids with high N/C ratio (Gln and Asn) and several intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle in abc1-1, suggesting that ABC1 plays a critical role in regulating nitrogen assimilation and carbon-nitrogen balance
