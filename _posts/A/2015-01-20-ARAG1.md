## Key message
1. __drought tolerance__, ["ARAG1, an ABA-responsive DREB gene, plays a role in seed germination and drought tolerance of rice"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term="ARAG1, an ABA-responsive DREB gene, plays a role in seed germination and drought tolerance of rice"%5BTitle%5D), "ARAG1, an ABA-responsive DREB gene, plays a role in seed germination and drought tolerance of rice"
2. __inflorescence__, [ARAG1, an ABA-responsive DREB gene, plays a role in seed germination and drought tolerance of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ARAG1, an ABA-responsive DREB gene, plays a role in seed germination and drought tolerance of rice%5BTitle%5D),  KEY RESULTS: ARAG1 was expressed in inflorescences, roots, immature embryos and germinating seeds, but not in coleoptiles, leaves or mature embryos
3. __ ABA __, [ARAG1, an ABA-responsive DREB gene, plays a role in seed germination and drought tolerance of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ARAG1, an ABA-responsive DREB gene, plays a role in seed germination and drought tolerance of rice%5BTitle%5D),  ARAG1 knockdown line was hypersensitive to ABA application during seed germination and seedling growth
