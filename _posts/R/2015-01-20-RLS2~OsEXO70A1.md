## Publication
1. [Disruption of OsEXO70A1 Causes Irregular Vascular Bundles and Perturbs Mineral Nutrient Assimilation in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Disruption of OsEXO70A1 Causes Irregular Vascular Bundles and Perturbs Mineral Nutrient Assimilation in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)), 2015, Sci Rep.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Expression analysis revealed that mutations in rls2 triggers transcriptional fluctuation of orthologous EXO70 genes and affects genes involved in primary nutrient absorption and transport  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:  

## Key message
1. __vascular bundle__, [Disruption of OsEXO70A1 Causes Irregular Vascular Bundles and Perturbs Mineral Nutrient Assimilation in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Disruption of OsEXO70A1 Causes Irregular Vascular Bundles and Perturbs Mineral Nutrient Assimilation in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  RLS2 was widely expressed and spatially restricted in vascular bundles
2. __vascular bundle__, [Disruption of OsEXO70A1 Causes Irregular Vascular Bundles and Perturbs Mineral Nutrient Assimilation in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Disruption of OsEXO70A1 Causes Irregular Vascular Bundles and Perturbs Mineral Nutrient Assimilation in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  In brief, our study revealed that RLS2 is required for normal vascular bundle differentiation and primary nutrient assimilation
3. __map-based cloning__, [Disruption of OsEXO70A1 Causes Irregular Vascular Bundles and Perturbs Mineral Nutrient Assimilation in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Disruption of OsEXO70A1 Causes Irregular Vascular Bundles and Perturbs Mineral Nutrient Assimilation in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Map-based cloning has revealed that RLS2 encodes OsEXO70A1, which is one of the 47 members of EXO70s in rice
