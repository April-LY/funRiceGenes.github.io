## Key message
1. __mitochondria__, [The rice DUF1620-containing and WD40-like repeat protein is required for the assembly of the restoration of fertility complex.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The rice DUF1620-containing and WD40-like repeat protein is required for the assembly of the restoration of fertility complex.%5BTitle%5D),  We established that RFC3 interacts with both RF5 and GRP162 in vitro and in vivo, and is transported into the mitochondria as a membrane protein
