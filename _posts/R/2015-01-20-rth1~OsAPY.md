## Key message
1. __growth__, [Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic plants with introduced OsAPY allele restored normal root hairs and plant growth, showing a complementation of rth1 phenotype
2. __growth__, [Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsAPY appears to be an important gene for root hair elongation and plant growth in rice
3. __root__, [Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic plants with introduced OsAPY allele restored normal root hairs and plant growth, showing a complementation of rth1 phenotype
4. __root__, [Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We concluded that the root hairless phenotype of rth1 is caused by a mutation of OsAPY
