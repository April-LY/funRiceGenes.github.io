## Key message
1. __palea__, [An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The DP1 enhancer SDP1 was also positional cloned, and was found identical to the recently reported RETARDED PALEA1 REP1 gene encoding a TCP family transcription factor
2. __floral__, [RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show that floral zygomorphy along the lemma-palea axis in rice Oryza sativa is partially or indirectly determined by the CYCLOIDEA CYC-like homolog RETARDED PALEA1 REP1), which regulates palea identity and development
3. __floral__, [RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The REP1 gene is only expressed in palea primordium during early flower development, but during later floral stages is radially dispersed in stamens and the vascular bundles of the lemma and palea
4. __floral__, [RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, ectopic expression of REP1 caused the asymmetrical overdifferentiation of the palea cells, altering their floral asymmetry
5. __stamen__, [RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The REP1 gene is only expressed in palea primordium during early flower development, but during later floral stages is radially dispersed in stamens and the vascular bundles of the lemma and palea
6. __flower__, [RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The REP1 gene is only expressed in palea primordium during early flower development, but during later floral stages is radially dispersed in stamens and the vascular bundles of the lemma and palea
7. __vascular bundle__, [RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The REP1 gene is only expressed in palea primordium during early flower development, but during later floral stages is radially dispersed in stamens and the vascular bundles of the lemma and palea
8. __vascular bundle__, [RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The development of palea is significantly retarded in the rep1 mutant and its palea has five vascular bundles, which is similar to the vascular pattern of the wild-type lemma
9. __palea__, [RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show that floral zygomorphy along the lemma-palea axis in rice Oryza sativa is partially or indirectly determined by the CYCLOIDEA CYC-like homolog RETARDED PALEA1 REP1), which regulates palea identity and development

16. __transcription factor__, [An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The DP1 enhancer SDP1 was also positional cloned, and was found identical to the recently reported RETARDED PALEA1 REP1 gene encoding a TCP family transcription factor
