## Expression information

## Key message
1. __vegetative__, [The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period%5BTitle%5D)), We isolated flattened shoot meristem (fsm) mutants in rice that showed defective seedling growth and died in the vegetative phase
2. __seedling__, [The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period%5BTitle%5D)), We isolated flattened shoot meristem (fsm) mutants in rice that showed defective seedling growth and died in the vegetative phase
3. __growth__, [The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period%5BTitle%5D)), We isolated flattened shoot meristem (fsm) mutants in rice that showed defective seedling growth and died in the vegetative phase
4. __shoot__, [The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period%5BTitle%5D)), We isolated flattened shoot meristem (fsm) mutants in rice that showed defective seedling growth and died in the vegetative phase
5. __shoot__, [The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period%5BTitle%5D)),  Since most fsm plants had flat and small shoot apical meristems (SAMs), we suggest that FSM is required for proper SAM maintenance
6. __meristem__, [The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period%5BTitle%5D)), The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period
7. __shoot__, [The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period%5BTitle%5D)), The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period
8. __meristem__, [The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period%5BTitle%5D)), We isolated flattened shoot meristem (fsm) mutants in rice that showed defective seedling growth and died in the vegetative phase
9. __meristem__, [The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period%5BTitle%5D)),  Since most fsm plants had flat and small shoot apical meristems (SAMs), we suggest that FSM is required for proper SAM maintenance
10. __shoot apical meristem__, [The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period%5BTitle%5D)),  Since most fsm plants had flat and small shoot apical meristems (SAMs), we suggest that FSM is required for proper SAM maintenance
