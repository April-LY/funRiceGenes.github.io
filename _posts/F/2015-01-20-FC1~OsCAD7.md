1. __tiller__, [FINE CULM1 FC1 works downstream of strigolactones to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=FINE CULM1 FC1 works downstream of strigolactones to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice%5BTitle%5D),  We found that the increased tillering phenotype of fine culm1 fc1 mutants of rice is not rescued by the application of 1 microM GR24, a synthetic SL analog
2. __tiller__, [FINE CULM1 FC1 works downstream of strigolactones to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=FINE CULM1 FC1 works downstream of strigolactones to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Treatment with a high concentration of GR24 10 microM causes suppression of tiller growth in wild-type plants, but is not effective on fc1 mutants, implying that proper FC1 functioning is required for SLs to inhibit bud growth
