## Expression information
__Expression__: We found that overexpression of FCP1 affects various aspects of leaf development in shoots regenerated from calli, making it difficult to distinguish between the leaf blade and leaf sheath |  Differentiation of tissues such as vascular bundle and sclerenchyma was strongly inhibited by FCP1 overexpression |  Spatial expression patterns of developmental genes DROOPING LEAF DL and OsPINHEAD1 OsPNH1 were severely affected in the FCP1-overexpressing shoots |  Whereas DL was expressed in the central region of leaf primordia in control shoots, DL expression was expanded throughout the leaf primordia of the FCP1-overexpressing shoots in early developmental stages |  By contrast, OsPNH1, which is expressed in provascular and developing vascular tissues in normal seedlings, was strongly repressed by FCP1 overexpression  
__OverExpression__: We found that overexpression of FCP1 affects various aspects of leaf development in shoots regenerated from calli, making it difficult to distinguish between the leaf blade and leaf sheath |  Differentiation of tissues such as vascular bundle and sclerenchyma was strongly inhibited by FCP1 overexpression |  By contrast, OsPNH1, which is expressed in provascular and developing vascular tissues in normal seedlings, was strongly repressed by FCP1 overexpression
