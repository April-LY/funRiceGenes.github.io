1. __iron__, [A rice phenolic efflux transporter is essential for solubilizing precipitated apoplasmic iron in the plant stele](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice phenolic efflux transporter is essential for solubilizing precipitated apoplasmic iron in the plant stele%5BTitle%5D)),  In the roots of pez1, precipitated apoplasmic iron increased

4. __transporter__, [The role of rice phenolics efflux transporter in solubilizing apoplasmic iron](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of rice phenolics efflux transporter in solubilizing apoplasmic iron%5BTitle%5D)),  Recently, we isolated and characterized a phenolics efflux transporter in rice by characterizing a mutant in which the amount of PCA and CA in the xylem sap was dramatically reduced, which we hence named phenolics efflux zero 1 (pez1)
5. __growth__, [A rice phenolic efflux transporter is essential for solubilizing precipitated apoplasmic iron in the plant stele](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice phenolic efflux transporter is essential for solubilizing precipitated apoplasmic iron in the plant stele%5BTitle%5D)),  The growth of PEZ1 overexpression lines was severely restricted, and these lines accumulated more iron as a result of the high solubilization of precipitated apoplasmic iron in the stele
