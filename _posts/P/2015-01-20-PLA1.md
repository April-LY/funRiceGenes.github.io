16. __PLA1__, __PLA2~LHD2__, [PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Double mutant analysis revealed that PLA1, PLA2 and PLA3 are regulated independently but function redundantly
