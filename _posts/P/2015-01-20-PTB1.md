## Key message
1. __pollen__, [Natural variation in PTB1 regulates rice seed setting rate by controlling pollen tube growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Natural variation in PTB1 regulates rice seed setting rate by controlling pollen tube growth%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we show that the domestication-related POLLEN TUBE BLOCKED 1 (PTB1), a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, positively regulates the rice panicle seed setting rate by promoting pollen tube growth
2. __pollen__, [Natural variation in PTB1 regulates rice seed setting rate by controlling pollen tube growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Natural variation in PTB1 regulates rice seed setting rate by controlling pollen tube growth%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results support the hypothesis that PTB1 is an important maternal sporophytic factor of pollen tube growth and a key modulator of the rice panicle seed setting rate
3. __pollen__, [Natural variation in PTB1 regulates rice seed setting rate by controlling pollen tube growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Natural variation in PTB1 regulates rice seed setting rate by controlling pollen tube growth%5BTitle%5D)), Natural variation in PTB1 regulates rice seed setting rate by controlling pollen tube growth
