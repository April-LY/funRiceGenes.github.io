## Key message
1. __meiotic__, [Pollen semi-sterility1 encodes a kinesin-1-like protein important for male meiosis, anther dehiscence, and fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Pollen semi-sterility1 encodes a kinesin-1-like protein important for male meiosis, anther dehiscence, and fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Together, our results suggest that PSS1 defines a novel member of the kinesin-1 family essential for male meiotic chromosomal dynamics, male gametogenesis, and anther dehiscence in rice
2. __sterility__, [Fine mapping of pss1, a pollen semi-sterile gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Fine mapping of pss1, a pollen semi-sterile gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D),  In this report, we found the female gamete of W207-2 was normal, and its semi-sterility was unaffected by growth duration but was conditioned by a recessive nuclear gene whose action leads to pollen semi-sterility and anther indehiscence, and the gene was named as pss1 (pollen semi-sterile)
