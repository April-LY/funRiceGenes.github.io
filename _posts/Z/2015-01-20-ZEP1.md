1. __meiotic__, [OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes
2. __drought__, [The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages%5BTitle%5D)), " The expression levels of the drought-responsive genes RD22, SODA1, bZIP46 and POD, as well as the ABA synthetic gene ZEP1 were up-regulated in the OsDIL-overexpression lines but the ABA degradation gene ABAOX3 was down-regulated"
3. __microspore__, [The central element protein ZEP1 of the synaptonemal complex regulates the number of crossovers during meiosis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The central element protein ZEP1 of the synaptonemal complex regulates the number of crossovers during meiosis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, ZEP1 is reloaded onto chromosomes in early microspores as the chromosome decondense, suggesting that ZEP1 might have other biological functions during this process
4. __meiosis__, [The central element protein ZEP1 of the synaptonemal complex regulates the number of crossovers during meiosis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The central element protein ZEP1 of the synaptonemal complex regulates the number of crossovers during meiosis in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The central element protein ZEP1 of the synaptonemal complex regulates the number of crossovers during meiosis in rice

6. __meiotic__, [The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
7. __meiotic__, [The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
8. __ ABA __, [The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression levels of the drought-responsive genes RD22, SODA1, bZIP46 and POD, as well as the ABA synthetic gene ZEP1 were up-regulated in the OsDIL-overexpression lines but the ABA degradation gene ABAOX3 was down-regulated
9. __meiosis__, [OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast, in pair2, Osmer3 and zep1 mutants, OsAM1 could be loaded normally, suggesting that OsAM1 plays a fundamental role in building the proper chromosome structure at the beginning of meiosis
