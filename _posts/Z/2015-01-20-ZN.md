* **Key message**  
    + Virus-induced gene silencing of a ZN homolog in Nicotiana benthamiana causes leaf variegation with sporadic green/yellow sectors, indicating that ZN is essential for chloroplast biogenesis during early leaf development
    + Together, we propose that ZN is required for protecting developing chloroplasts, especially during the assembly of thylakoid protein complexes, from incidental light after darkness

    + __OsMTP11__, __ZN__, [Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.%5BTitle%5D),  Real time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated OsMTP11 expression was substantially enhanced following 4 h under Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn treatments, suggesting possible roles of OsMTP11 involvement in heavy metal stress responses
    + __OsMTP11__, __ZN__, [Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.%5BTitle%5D),  DNA methylation assays of genomic DNA in rice treated with Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn revealed that decreased DNA methylation levels were present in the OsMTP11 promoter region, which was consistent with OsMTP11 induced-expression patterns resulting from heavy metal stress
    + __OsMTP11__, __ZN__, [OsMTP11 is localised at the Golgi and contributes to Mn tolerance.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsMTP11 is localised at the Golgi and contributes to Mn tolerance.%5BTitle%5D),  OsMTP11 partially rescues the Mn-hypersensitivity of the pmr1 yeast mutant but only slightly alleviates the Zn sensitivity of the zrc1 cot1 yeast mutant
    + __OsMTP11__, __ZN__, [OsMTP11 is localised at the Golgi and contributes to Mn tolerance.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsMTP11 is localised at the Golgi and contributes to Mn tolerance.%5BTitle%5D),  Overall, these results suggest that OsMTP11 predominantly functions as a Mn-transporting CDF with lower affinity for Zn
    + __OsZIP7a~OsZIP7__, __ZN__, [Elemental Profiling of Rice FOX Lines Leads to Characterization of a New Zn Plasma Membrane Transporter, OsZIP7.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Elemental Profiling of Rice FOX Lines Leads to Characterization of a New Zn Plasma Membrane Transporter, OsZIP7.%5BTitle%5D), Elemental Profiling of Rice FOX Lines Leads to Characterization of a New Zn Plasma Membrane Transporter, OsZIP7.
    + __OsZIP7a~OsZIP7__, __ZN__, [Elemental Profiling of Rice FOX Lines Leads to Characterization of a New Zn Plasma Membrane Transporter, OsZIP7.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Elemental Profiling of Rice FOX Lines Leads to Characterization of a New Zn Plasma Membrane Transporter, OsZIP7.%5BTitle%5D),  OsZIP7 expression in Arabidopsis resulted in a 25% increase in shoot Zn concentrations compared to non-transformed plants
    + __OsZIP7a~OsZIP7__, __ZN__, [Elemental Profiling of Rice FOX Lines Leads to Characterization of a New Zn Plasma Membrane Transporter, OsZIP7.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Elemental Profiling of Rice FOX Lines Leads to Characterization of a New Zn Plasma Membrane Transporter, OsZIP7.%5BTitle%5D),  We further characterized OsZIP7 and showed that it is localized to the plasma membrane and is able to complement Zn transport defective (but not Fe defective) yeast mutants
    + __OsZIP7a~OsZIP7__, __ZN__, [Elemental Profiling of Rice FOX Lines Leads to Characterization of a New Zn Plasma Membrane Transporter, OsZIP7.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Elemental Profiling of Rice FOX Lines Leads to Characterization of a New Zn Plasma Membrane Transporter, OsZIP7.%5BTitle%5D),  Our results indicate that OsZIP7 is a good candidate for developing Zn biofortified rice
