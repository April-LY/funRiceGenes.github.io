2. __salt__, ["Identification of a rice zinc finger protein whose expression is transiently induced by drought, cold but not by salinity and abscisic acid"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term="Identification of a rice zinc finger protein whose expression is transiently induced by drought, cold but not by salinity and abscisic acid"%5BTitle%5D), " However, ZFP245 was not regulated by high salt or abscisic acid treatment"
3. __drought__, ["Identification of a rice zinc finger protein whose expression is transiently induced by drought, cold but not by salinity and abscisic acid"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term="Identification of a rice zinc finger protein whose expression is transiently induced by drought, cold but not by salinity and abscisic acid"%5BTitle%5D), " The semi-quantitative-RT-PCR assay revealed ZFP245 was strongly induced after 6 h exposure to cold and drought stresses, and then reduced to the baseline
