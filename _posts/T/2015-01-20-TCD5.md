* **Key message**  
    + The development of chloroplasts and etioplasts is impaired in tcd5 plants at 20 °C, and the temperature-sensitive period for the albino phenotype is the P4 stage of leaf development
    + Although the phenotype and temperature dependence of the TCD5 orthologous mutant phenotype were different in rice and Arabidopsis, OsTCD5 could rescue the phenotype of the Arabidopsis mutant, suggesting that TCD5 function is conserved between monocots and dicots
    + The development of thylakoid membranes is arrested at the mid-P4 stage in tcd5 plants at 20 °C
    + The transcription of some genes involved in plastid transcription/translation and photosynthesis varied in the tcd5 mutant
