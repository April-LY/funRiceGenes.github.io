* **Key message**  
    + A Nucleus-Encoded Chloroplast Protein YL1 Is Involved in Chloroplast Development and Efficient Biogenesis of Chloroplast ATP Synthase in Rice.
    + The YL1 mutation showed reduced chlorophyll contents, abnormal chloroplast morphology, and decreased photochemical efficiency
    + Moreover, YL1 deficiency disrupts the expression of genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis
