## Key message
1. __leaf development__, [Young Leaf Chlorosis 1, a chloroplast-localized gene required for chlorophyll and lutein accumulation during early leaf development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Young Leaf Chlorosis 1, a chloroplast-localized gene required for chlorophyll and lutein accumulation during early leaf development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These data suggested that the YLC1 protein may be involved in Chl and lutein accumulation and chloroplast development at early leaf development in rice
2. __photosynthesis__, [Young Leaf Chlorosis 1, a chloroplast-localized gene required for chlorophyll and lutein accumulation during early leaf development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Young Leaf Chlorosis 1, a chloroplast-localized gene required for chlorophyll and lutein accumulation during early leaf development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Real-time PCR analyses showed that the expression levels of the genes associated with Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis were affected in ylc1 mutant at different temperatures
3. __leaf__, [Young Leaf Chlorosis 1, a chloroplast-localized gene required for chlorophyll and lutein accumulation during early leaf development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Young Leaf Chlorosis 1, a chloroplast-localized gene required for chlorophyll and lutein accumulation during early leaf development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In this study, we characterized a rice mutant named young leaf chlorosis 1 ylc1 from a 60Co-irradiated population
4. __leaf__, [Young Leaf Chlorosis 1, a chloroplast-localized gene required for chlorophyll and lutein accumulation during early leaf development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Young Leaf Chlorosis 1, a chloroplast-localized gene required for chlorophyll and lutein accumulation during early leaf development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The Young Leaf Chlorosis 1 YLC1 gene was isolated via map-based cloning and identified to encode a protein of unknown function belonging to the DUF3353 superfamily
5. __leaf__, [Young Leaf Chlorosis 1, a chloroplast-localized gene required for chlorophyll and lutein accumulation during early leaf development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Young Leaf Chlorosis 1, a chloroplast-localized gene required for chlorophyll and lutein accumulation during early leaf development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These data suggested that the YLC1 protein may be involved in Chl and lutein accumulation and chloroplast development at early leaf development in rice
6. __chloroplast__, [Young Leaf Chlorosis 1, a chloroplast-localized gene required for chlorophyll and lutein accumulation during early leaf development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Young Leaf Chlorosis 1, a chloroplast-localized gene required for chlorophyll and lutein accumulation during early leaf development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In rice protoplasts, the YLC1 protein displayed a typical chloroplast location pattern
7. __chloroplast__, [Young Leaf Chlorosis 1, a chloroplast-localized gene required for chlorophyll and lutein accumulation during early leaf development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Young Leaf Chlorosis 1, a chloroplast-localized gene required for chlorophyll and lutein accumulation during early leaf development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These data suggested that the YLC1 protein may be involved in Chl and lutein accumulation and chloroplast development at early leaf development in rice
8. __temperature__, ["Young Leaf Chlorosis 1, a chloroplast-localized gene required for chlorophyll and lutein accumulation during early leaf development in rice"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term="Young Leaf Chlorosis 1, a chloroplast-localized gene required for chlorophyll and lutein accumulation during early leaf development in rice"%5BTitle%5D),  Real-time PCR analyses showed that the expression levels of the genes associated with Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis were affected in ylc1 mutant at different temperatures
