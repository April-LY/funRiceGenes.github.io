* **Key message**  
    + These data suggested that the YLC1 protein may be involved in Chl and lutein accumulation and chloroplast development at early leaf development in rice
    + Real-time PCR analyses showed that the expression levels of the genes associated with Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis were affected in ylc1 mutant at different temperatures
    + In this study, we characterized a rice mutant named young leaf chlorosis 1 (ylc1) from a (6)(0)Co-irradiated population
    + The Young Leaf Chlorosis 1 (YLC1) gene was isolated via map-based cloning and identified to encode a protein of unknown function belonging to the DUF3353 superfamily
    + In rice protoplasts, the YLC1 protein displayed a typical chloroplast location pattern
