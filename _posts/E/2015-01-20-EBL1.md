## Connection
1. __EBL1__, __OsACO1__, [Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Since the OsEREBP1-like gene EBL1 OsEREBP1-LIKE 1 was significantly downregulated in phyAphyBphyC mutants, EBL1 was suspected to repress ACO1 expression in wild-type plants
2. __EBL1__, __OsACO1__, [Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  However, ACO1 was downregulated in EBL1 RNA interference plants, and the total length of these plants was slightly shorter than that of wild-type plants
3. __EBL1__, __OsACO1__, [Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  This study shows that EBL1 is positively regulated by phytochrome B and associated with ACO1 upregulation
4. __EBL1__, __OsACO1__, [Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice%5BTitle%5D), Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice
5. __EBL1__, __OsEREBP1__, [Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Since the OsEREBP1-like gene EBL1 OsEREBP1-LIKE 1 was significantly downregulated in phyAphyBphyC mutants, EBL1 was suspected to repress ACO1 expression in wild-type plants
