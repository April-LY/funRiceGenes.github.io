## Key message
1. __ ABA __, [Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Overexpression of MAIF1 reduces rice ABA sensitivity and abiotic stress tolerance and promotes rice root growth
2. __root__, [Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice%5BTitle%5D),  MAIF1 expression is also induced in root tips by sucrose, independent of its hydrolytic hexose products, glucose and fructose, and the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin
3. __root__, [Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Overexpression of MAIF1 reduces rice ABA sensitivity and abiotic stress tolerance and promotes rice root growth
4. __root__, [Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that MAIF1 is involved in multiple signaling pathways in regulating root growth
5. __root__, [Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Our results also suggest that MAIF1 plays the negative role in response to abiotic stress possibly by regulating root growth
6. __auxin__, [Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice%5BTitle%5D),  MAIF1 expression is also induced in root tips by sucrose, independent of its hydrolytic hexose products, glucose and fructose, and the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin
7. __growth__, [Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Overexpression of MAIF1 reduces rice ABA sensitivity and abiotic stress tolerance and promotes rice root growth
8. __growth__, [Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that MAIF1 is involved in multiple signaling pathways in regulating root growth

10. __abiotic stress__, [Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice%5BTitle%5D),  MAIF1 expression is induced rapidly and strongly by abscisic acid ABA and abiotic stresses
11. __abiotic stress__, [Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Overexpression of MAIF1 reduces rice ABA sensitivity and abiotic stress tolerance and promotes rice root growth
12. __abiotic stress__, [Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Our results also suggest that MAIF1 plays the negative role in response to abiotic stress possibly by regulating root growth
13. __cytokinin__, [Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice%5BTitle%5D),  MAIF1 expression is also induced in root tips by sucrose, independent of its hydrolytic hexose products, glucose and fructose, and the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin
