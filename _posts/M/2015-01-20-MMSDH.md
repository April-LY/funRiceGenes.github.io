## Key message
1. __gibberellin__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  MMSDH responded to auxin and gibberellin, but did not respond to brassinolide and cytokinin
2. __gibberellin__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, the amount of MMSDH in slr1, a constitutive gibberellin response mutant, was 2-fold that of wild type
3. __leaf__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  MMSDH was detected in cultured suspension cells, root and leaf sheath, but not in leaf blades
4. __sheath__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  MMSDH was detected in cultured suspension cells, root and leaf sheath, but not in leaf blades
5. __auxin__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Of these seven, methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase MMSDH was elevated by treatment with auxin alone
6. __auxin__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  MMSDH responded to auxin and gibberellin, but did not respond to brassinolide and cytokinin
7. __auxin__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  MMSDH mRNA and protein were stimulated in root formation induced by auxin and/or zinc over a 4-week period
8. __auxin__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that MMSDH may be necessary for root formation in rice induced by auxin and/or zinc
9. __cytokinin__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  MMSDH responded to auxin and gibberellin, but did not respond to brassinolide and cytokinin
10. __root__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  MMSDH was detected in cultured suspension cells, root and leaf sheath, but not in leaf blades
11. __root__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  MMSDH mRNA and protein were stimulated in root formation induced by auxin and/or zinc over a 4-week period
12. __root__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that MMSDH may be necessary for root formation in rice induced by auxin and/or zinc
13. __zinc__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  MMSDH mRNA and protein were stimulated in root formation induced by auxin and/or zinc over a 4-week period
14. __zinc__, [Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase is induced in auxin-stimulated and zinc-stimulated root formation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that MMSDH may be necessary for root formation in rice induced by auxin and/or zinc
