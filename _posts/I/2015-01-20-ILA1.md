## Key message
1. __vascular bundle__, [Increased leaf angle1, a Raf-like MAPKKK that interacts with a nuclear protein family, regulates mechanical tissue formation in the Lamina joint of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Increased leaf angle1, a Raf-like MAPKKK that interacts with a nuclear protein family, regulates mechanical tissue formation in the Lamina joint of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The increased leaf angle in ila1 is caused by abnormal vascular bundle formation and cell wall composition in the leaf lamina joint, as distinct from the mechanism observed in brassinosteroid-related mutants

3. __leaf__, [Increased leaf angle1, a Raf-like MAPKKK that interacts with a nuclear protein family, regulates mechanical tissue formation in the Lamina joint of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Increased leaf angle1, a Raf-like MAPKKK that interacts with a nuclear protein family, regulates mechanical tissue formation in the Lamina joint of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We report here the characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, increased leaf angle1 (ila1), resulting from a T-DNA insertion in a Group C MAPKKK gene
