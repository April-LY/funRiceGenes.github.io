## Key message
1. __resistant__, [R gene expression induced by a type-III effector triggers disease resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(R gene expression induced by a type-III effector triggers disease resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Resistant and susceptible alleles of Xa27 encode identical proteins
2. __resistant__, [R gene expression induced by a type-III effector triggers disease resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(R gene expression induced by a type-III effector triggers disease resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  However, expression of only the resistant allele occurs when a rice plant is challenged by bacteria harbouring avrXa27, whose product is a nuclear localized type-III effector"
