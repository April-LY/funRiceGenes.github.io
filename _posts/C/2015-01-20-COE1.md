## Key message
1. __brassinosteroid__, [COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  COE1 encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, whose amino acid sequence is similar to that of brassinosteroid-insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase 1 BAK1), and which is localized at the plasma membrane
2. __brassinosteroid__, [COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Because of the sequence similarity of COE1 to BAK1, we also examined the involvement of brassinosteroids in CV formation
3. __brassinosteroid__, [COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Brassinolide, an active brassinosteroid, decreased the CV intervals of wild-type rice, and brassinazole, an inhibitor of brassinosteroid biosynthesis, increased the CV intervals of wild-type rice, but coe1 mutants showed insensitivity to these chemicals
4. __brassinosteroid__, [COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that auxin and brassinosteroids regulate CV intervals in opposite directions, and COE1 may regulate CV intervals downstream of auxin and brassinosteroid signals
5. __auxin__, [COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that auxin and brassinosteroids regulate CV intervals in opposite directions, and COE1 may regulate CV intervals downstream of auxin and brassinosteroid signals
