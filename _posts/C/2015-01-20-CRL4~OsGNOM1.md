## Key message
1. __anther__, [Adventitious root formation in rice requires OsGNOM1 and is mediated by the OsPINs family](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Adventitious root formation in rice requires OsGNOM1 and is mediated by the OsPINs family%5BTitle%5D)),  RT-PCR and analysis of promoter::GUS transgenic plants showed that OsGNOM1 is expressed in AR primordia, vascular tissues, LRs, root tips, leaves, anthers and lemma veins, with a distribution pattern similar to that of auxin
2. __crown root__, [CRL4 regulates crown root formation through auxin transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CRL4 regulates crown root formation through auxin transport in rice%5BTitle%5D)), ) mutant crown rootless4 (crl4) that was found to have defective crown root formation
3. __crown root__, [CRL4 regulates crown root formation through auxin transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CRL4 regulates crown root formation through auxin transport in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Besides reduced crown root number, the crl4 mutant showed auxin-related abnormal phenotypical character-istics such as reduced lateral root number and impaired root gravitropism
4. __crown root__, [CRL4 regulates crown root formation through auxin transport in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CRL4 regulates crown root formation through auxin transport in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results indicate that maintaining an appropriate auxin accumulation and gradient through CRL4 in the basal portion of shoots is essential for crown root formation in rice
