## Key message
1. __oxidative__, [Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage%5BTitle%5D)), " We propose that NTRC constitutes an alternative system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage, using NADPH as the source of reducing power
2. __oxidative__, [Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage%5BTitle%5D)),  Since no light-driven reduced ferredoxin is produced at night, the NTRC-BAS1 pathway may be a key detoxification system during darkness, with NADPH produced by the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway as the source of reducing power
3. __oxidative__, [Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage%5BTitle%5D)), Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage"
4. __photosynthesis__, [Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage%5BTitle%5D)),  An Arabidopsis thaliana knockout mutant for NTRC shows irregular mesophyll cell shape, abnormal chloroplast structure, and unbalanced BAS1 redox state, resulting in impaired photosynthesis rate under low light
5. __chloroplast__, [Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage%5BTitle%5D)),  We show that rice (Oryza sativa) chloroplast NADPH THIOREDOXIN REDUCTASE (NTRC), with a thioredoxin domain, uses NADPH to reduce the chloroplast 2-Cys peroxiredoxin BAS1, which then reduces hydrogen peroxide
6. __chloroplast__, [Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage%5BTitle%5D)),  An Arabidopsis thaliana knockout mutant for NTRC shows irregular mesophyll cell shape, abnormal chloroplast structure, and unbalanced BAS1 redox state, resulting in impaired photosynthesis rate under low light

9. __phosphate__, [Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage%5BTitle%5D)),  Since no light-driven reduced ferredoxin is produced at night, the NTRC-BAS1 pathway may be a key detoxification system during darkness, with NADPH produced by the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway as the source of reducing power
10. __senescence__, [Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, prolonged darkness followed by light/dark incubation produced an increase in hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation in leaves and accelerated senescence of NTRC-deficient plants
