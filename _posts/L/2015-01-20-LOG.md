## Expression information

## Key message
1. __shoot__, [Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme%5BTitle%5D)),  The LONELY GUY (LOG) gene of rice is required to maintain meristem activity and its loss of function causes premature termination of the shoot meristem
2. __shoot__, [Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme%5BTitle%5D)),  LOG messenger RNA is specifically localized in shoot meristem tips, indicating the activation of cytokinins in a specific developmental domain
3. __meristem__, [Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme%5BTitle%5D)),  The LONELY GUY (LOG) gene of rice is required to maintain meristem activity and its loss of function causes premature termination of the shoot meristem
4. __meristem__, [Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme%5BTitle%5D)),  LOG messenger RNA is specifically localized in shoot meristem tips, indicating the activation of cytokinins in a specific developmental domain
5. __cytokinin__, [Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme%5BTitle%5D)),  LOG encodes a novel cytokinin-activating enzyme that works in the final step of bioactive cytokinin synthesis
6. __cytokinin__, [Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme%5BTitle%5D)),  Revising the long-held idea of multistep reactions, LOG directly converts inactive cytokinin nucleotides to the free-base forms, which are biologically active, by its cytokinin-specific phosphoribohydrolase activity
7. __cytokinin__, [Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme%5BTitle%5D)),  LOG messenger RNA is specifically localized in shoot meristem tips, indicating the activation of cytokinins in a specific developmental domain
