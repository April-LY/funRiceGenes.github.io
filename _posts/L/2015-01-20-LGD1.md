## Expression information

## Key message
1. __grain yield__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield
2. __vegetative__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results demonstrated that LGD1 pleiotropically regulated rice vegetative growth and development through both the distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns of its multiple transcripts and RNA binding activity
3. __growth__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, T-DNA mutant and RNAi transgenic approaches were used to functionally characterize a unique rice gene, LAGGING GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 1 (LGD1)
4. __growth__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield
5. __growth__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results demonstrated that LGD1 pleiotropically regulated rice vegetative growth and development through both the distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns of its multiple transcripts and RNA binding activity
6. __growth__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)), Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters
7. __grain__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield
8. __architecture__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield
9. __panicle architecture__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield
10. __height__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield
11. __tiller number__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield
12. __tiller number__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  The fewer unelongated internodes and cells in lgd1 led to respective reductions in tiller number and to semi-dwarfism
