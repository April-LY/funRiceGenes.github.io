* **Key message**  
    + Mice HEI10(mei4) mutant displays no obvious defect other than meiotic failure from an absence of chiasmata
    + In this study, we characterize rice HEI10 by map-based cloning and explore its function during meiotic recombination
    + HEI10 protein displays a highly dynamic localization on the meiotic chromosomes
    + Together our results suggest that HEI10 is the homolog of budding yeast Zip3 and Caenorhabditis elegans ZHP-3, and may specifically promote class I CO formation through modification of various meiotic components
    + The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers
    + OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10
    + HEI10 was first described in human as a RING domain-containing protein that regulates cell cycle and cell invasion
