## Expression information

## Key message
1. __meiotic__, [The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers%5BTitle%5D),  Mice HEI10mei4 mutant displays no obvious defect other than meiotic failure from an absence of chiasmata
2. __meiotic__, [The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers%5BTitle%5D),  In this study, we characterize rice HEI10 by map-based cloning and explore its function during meiotic recombination
3. __meiotic__, [The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers%5BTitle%5D),  HEI10 protein displays a highly dynamic localization on the meiotic chromosomes
4. __meiotic__, [The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers%5BTitle%5D),  Together our results suggest that HEI10 is the homolog of budding yeast Zip3 and Caenorhabditis elegans ZHP-3, and may specifically promote class I CO formation through modification of various meiotic components
5. __meiotic__, [The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers%5BTitle%5D), The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers
6. __meiotic__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10
7. __cell cycle__, [The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers%5BTitle%5D), HEI10 was first described in human as a RING domain-containing protein that regulates cell cycle and cell invasion
