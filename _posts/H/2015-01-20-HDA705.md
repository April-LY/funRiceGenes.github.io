## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: In this study, we examined the expression pattern and function of HDA705, a member of the RPD3/HDA1-type HDAC in rice |  Overexpression of HDA705 in rice decreased ABA and salt stress resistance during seed germination |  Delayed seed germination of HDA705 overexpression lines was associated with down-regulated expression of GA biosynthetic genes and up-regulation of ABA biosynthetic genes |  Moreover, overexpression of HDA705 in rice enhanced osmotic stress resistance during the seedling stage  
__OverExpression__: Overexpression of HDA705 in rice decreased ABA and salt stress resistance during seed germination |  Delayed seed germination of HDA705 overexpression lines was associated with down-regulated expression of GA biosynthetic genes and up-regulation of ABA biosynthetic genes |  Moreover, overexpression of HDA705 in rice enhanced osmotic stress resistance during the seedling stage
