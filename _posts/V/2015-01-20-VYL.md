## Key message
1. __leaf__, [A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants%5BTitle%5D)),  In this work, we isolated a virescent yellow leaf (vyl) mutant in rice (Oryza sativa), which produces chlorotic leaves throughout the entire growth period

3. __growth__, [A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants%5BTitle%5D)),  In this work, we isolated a virescent yellow leaf (vyl) mutant in rice (Oryza sativa), which produces chlorotic leaves throughout the entire growth period
4. __chloroplast__, [A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Positional cloning revealed that the VYL gene encodes a protein homologous to the Arabidopsis ClpP6 subunit and that it is targeted to the chloroplast
5. __chloroplast__, [A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants%5BTitle%5D)),  VYL expression is constitutive in most tissues examined but most abundant in leaf sections containing chloroplasts in early stages of development

## Connection
1. __CLPP4__, __VYL__, [A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Using a tandem affinity purification approach and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified OsClpP4 as a VYL-associated protein in vivo
