* **Key message**  
    + Our results demonstrate that VAL1 is a crucial enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway and is involved in regulating chloroplast development, chlorophyll metabolism, and cell division during leaf development in rice
    + Subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that VAL1 was localized in the chloroplast
    + Map-based cloning revealed that VAL1 encodes a phosphoribosylamine-glycine ligase (PurD), the second enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway
