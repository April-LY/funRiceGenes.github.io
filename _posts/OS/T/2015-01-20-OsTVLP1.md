## Key message
1. __disease__, [Molecular cloning and expression analysis of rice OsTVLP1, encoding a protein with similarity to TGF-β receptor interacting proteins and vacuolar assembly Vam6p/Vps39p proteins](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and expression analysis of rice OsTVLP1, encoding a protein with similarity to TGF-β receptor interacting proteins and vacuolar assembly Vam6p/Vps39p proteins%5BTitle%5D),  The expression of OsTVLP1 was induced by treatments with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical activator of plant disease resistance responses, and by infection of the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea
