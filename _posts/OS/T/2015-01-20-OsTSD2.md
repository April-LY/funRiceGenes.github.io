* **Key message**  
    + Rice putative methyltransferase gene OsTSD2 is required for root development involving pectin modification.
    + All three independent T-DNA insertion lines of OsTSD2 displayed dwarf phenotypes and serial alterations in different zones of the root
    + Increased endogenous ABA content and opposite roles performed by ABA and IAA in regulating cellular adhesion in the Ostsd2 mutants suggested that OsTSD2 is required for root development in rice through a pathway involving pectin synthesis/modification
    + Biochemical analysis of cell wall pectin polysaccharides revealed that both the monosaccharide composition and the uronic acid content were decreased in Ostsd2 mutants
    + Here, we report the functional characterization of the OsTSD2 gene, which encodes a putative methyltransferase in rice
