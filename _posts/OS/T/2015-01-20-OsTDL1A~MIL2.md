## Key message
1. __anther__, [MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther%5BTitle%5D),  We report here that the gene MICROSPORELESS2 (MIL2) regulates early anther cell differentiation in rice (Oryza sativa)
2. __anther__, [MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther%5BTitle%5D),  The anthers of mil2 mutants were characterized using molecular markers and cytological examination
3. __anther__, [MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther%5BTitle%5D),  However, mil2 anthers display phenotypes different from those of tpd1 mutants, with only two layers of anther wall cells formed
4. __anther__, [MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther%5BTitle%5D),  Our results demonstrate that MIL2 is responsible for the differentiation of primary parietal cells into secondary parietal cells in rice anthers, and suggest that rice and Arabidopsis anthers might share similar regulators in anther patterning, but divergent mechanisms are employed in these processes

8. __meiosis__, [OsTDL1A binds to the LRR domain of rice receptor kinase MSP1, and is required to limit sporocyte numbers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsTDL1A binds to the LRR domain of rice receptor kinase MSP1, and is required to limit sporocyte numbers%5BTitle%5D),  Both are co-expressed with MSP1 in anthers during meiosis, but only OsTDL1A and MSP1 are co-expressed in the ovule
9. __anther__, [OsTDL1A binds to the LRR domain of rice receptor kinase MSP1, and is required to limit sporocyte numbers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsTDL1A binds to the LRR domain of rice receptor kinase MSP1, and is required to limit sporocyte numbers%5BTitle%5D),  Both are co-expressed with MSP1 in anthers during meiosis, but only OsTDL1A and MSP1 are co-expressed in the ovule
10. __anther__, [OsTDL1A binds to the LRR domain of rice receptor kinase MSP1, and is required to limit sporocyte numbers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsTDL1A binds to the LRR domain of rice receptor kinase MSP1, and is required to limit sporocyte numbers%5BTitle%5D),  When driven by the maize Ubiquitin1 promoter, RNA interference against OsTDL1A phenocopies msp1 in the ovule but not in the anther
11. __tapetum__, [MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther%5BTitle%5D),  MIL2 encodes the rice homolog of the Arabidopsis TAPETUM DETERMINANT1 (TPD1) protein

## Connection
1. __OsTDL1A~MIL2__, __OsTDL1B__, [OsTDL1A binds to the LRR domain of rice receptor kinase MSP1, and is required to limit sporocyte numbers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsTDL1A binds to the LRR domain of rice receptor kinase MSP1, and is required to limit sporocyte numbers%5BTitle%5D),  Here we show that rice contains two TPD1-like genes, OsTDL1A and OsTDL1B
2. __OsTDL1A~MIL2__, __OsTDL1B__, [OsTDL1A binds to the LRR domain of rice receptor kinase MSP1, and is required to limit sporocyte numbers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsTDL1A binds to the LRR domain of rice receptor kinase MSP1, and is required to limit sporocyte numbers%5BTitle%5D),  OsTDL1A binds to the leucine-rich-repeat domain of MSP1 in yeast two-hybrid assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation in onion cells; OsTDL1B lacks this capacity
