## Key message
1. __seed__, [Functional analysis of OsTUB8, an anther-specific β-tubulin in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of OsTUB8, an anther-specific β-tubulin in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Transgenic rice expressing OsTUB8 in an antisense orientation were suppressed in the amount of seed set upon maturity
2. __seed__, [Functional analysis of OsTUB8, an anther-specific β-tubulin in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of OsTUB8, an anther-specific β-tubulin in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that OsTUB8 might be differentially expressed in rice anthers due to the action of GA, and involved in the processes of vegetative growth and seed set in rice
3. __anther__, [Functional analysis of OsTUB8, an anther-specific β-tubulin in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of OsTUB8, an anther-specific β-tubulin in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsTUB8 that was expressed in rice anthers was characterized with a multi-level approach
4. __anther__, [Functional analysis of OsTUB8, an anther-specific β-tubulin in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of OsTUB8, an anther-specific β-tubulin in rice%5BTitle%5D),  At the protein level, OsTUB8 was expressed mainly in anthers compared to callus, root, leaf sheath and leaf blade
