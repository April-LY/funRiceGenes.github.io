* **Genbank accession number**  
    + [AF486280](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AF486280)

* **Key message**  
    + RT-PCR experiments revealed that Os6PGDH expression was high in inflorescence, low in root and embryos but almost absent in leaves
    + Furthermore, Os6PGDH was up-regulated in the shoots under salt stress
