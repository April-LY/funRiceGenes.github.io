## Publication
1. [Emerging Importance of Helicases in Plant Stress Tolerance: Characterization of Oryza sativa Repair Helicase XPB2 Promoter and Its Functional Validation in Tobacco under Multiple Stresses.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Emerging Importance of Helicases in Plant Stress Tolerance: Characterization of Oryza sativa Repair Helicase XPB2 Promoter and Its Functional Validation in Tobacco under Multiple Stresses.%5BTitle%5D), 2015, Front Plant Sci.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: The present research revealed that OsXPB2 promoter contains cis-elements accounting for various abiotic stresses salt, dehydration, or cold and hormone Auxin, ABA, or MeJA induced GUS expression/activity in the promoter-reporter assay |  The present findings suggest that OsXPB2 promoter is a multi-stress inducible promoter and has potential applications in sustainable crop production under abiotic stresses by regulating desirable pattern of gene expression  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:
