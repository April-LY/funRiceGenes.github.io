## Key message
1. __seed__, [Identification, cDNA cloning and possible roles of seed-specific rice asparaginyl endopeptidase, REP-2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification, cDNA cloning and possible roles of seed-specific rice asparaginyl endopeptidase, REP-2%5BTitle%5D),  Northern blot analysis indicated that REP-2 mRNA was expressed in both maturing and germinating seeds
2. __seed__, [Identification, cDNA cloning and possible roles of seed-specific rice asparaginyl endopeptidase, REP-2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification, cDNA cloning and possible roles of seed-specific rice asparaginyl endopeptidase, REP-2%5BTitle%5D),  Incubation of the de-embryonated seeds in 10-6 M gibberellic acid induced the production of large amounts of REP-1, whereas REP-2beta levels declined rapidly
