## Key message
1. __growth__, [Structure, chromosomal location and expression of a rice gene encoding the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Structure, chromosomal location and expression of a rice gene encoding the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase%5BTitle%5D)),  The accumulation of the OsFAD3 mRNA in leaf tissues remained at quite low levels, both at normal growth temperatures and at chilling temperatures
2. __seed__, [Identification and evaluation of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase genes for hyperfortifying alpha-linolenic acid in transgenic rice seed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and evaluation of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase genes for hyperfortifying alpha-linolenic acid in transgenic rice seed%5BTitle%5D)),  The ALA contents in the seeds of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized GmFAD3-1 and OsFAD3 overexpression lines increased from 0

10. __root__, [Structure, chromosomal location and expression of a rice gene encoding the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Structure, chromosomal location and expression of a rice gene encoding the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of the OsFAD3 cDNA in tobacco hairy root tissues and subsequent analysis of fatty acid compositions demonstrated the activity of the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase

## Connection
1. __OsFAD3__, __OsFAD7__, [Identification and evaluation of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase genes for hyperfortifying alpha-linolenic acid in transgenic rice seed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and evaluation of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase genes for hyperfortifying alpha-linolenic acid in transgenic rice seed%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of ER-localized GmFAD3-2/3 and chloroplast-localized OsFAD7/8 had less effect on increasing the ALA content in rice seeds
