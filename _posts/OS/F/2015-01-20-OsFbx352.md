## Key message
1. __seed__, [A rice F-box gene, OsFbx352, is involved in glucose-delayed seed germination in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice F-box gene, OsFbx352, is involved in glucose-delayed seed germination in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  This study isolated a gene (OsFbx352) from rice encoding an F-box domain protein and characterized its role in seed germination
2. __seed__, [A rice F-box gene, OsFbx352, is involved in glucose-delayed seed germination in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice F-box gene, OsFbx352, is involved in glucose-delayed seed germination in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The transcripts of OsFbx352 were increased upon imbibition of rice seeds and the increase was markedly suppressed by glucose
3. __seed__, [A rice F-box gene, OsFbx352, is involved in glucose-delayed seed germination in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice F-box gene, OsFbx352, is involved in glucose-delayed seed germination in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Germination of seeds with overexpression of OsFbx352 was less suppressed by glucose than that of wild-type seeds, while glucose had greater inhibition for germination of seeds with knockdown of OsFbx352 by RNA interference (RNAi) than that of wild-type seeds
