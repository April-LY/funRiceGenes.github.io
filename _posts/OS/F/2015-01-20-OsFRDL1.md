## Key message
1. __transporter__, [A rice FRD3-like (OsFRDL1) gene is expressed in the cells involved in long-distance transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice FRD3-like (OsFRDL1) gene is expressed in the cells involved in long-distance transport%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that OsFRDL1 is a transporter that resides in the plasma membrane of cells involved in long-distant transport
2. __aluminum__, [OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we report the function of a rice (Oryza sativa) MATE gene (Os03g0216700, OsFRDL1), the closest homolog of barley (Hordeum vulgare) HvAACT1 (aluminum [Al]-activated citrate transporter 1), in terms of metal stress (iron [Fe] deficiency and Al toxicity)
3. __reproductive__, [A rice FRD3-like (OsFRDL1) gene is expressed in the cells involved in long-distance transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice FRD3-like (OsFRDL1) gene is expressed in the cells involved in long-distance transport%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, OsFRDL1 expression was observed during the reproductive stage
4. __iron__, [A rice FRD3-like (OsFRDL1) gene is expressed in the cells involved in long-distance transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice FRD3-like (OsFRDL1) gene is expressed in the cells involved in long-distance transport%5BTitle%5D),  Of these, we cloned three OsFRDL genes from a cDNA library prepared from iron-deficient rice roots: OsFRDL1, OsFRDL2, and OsFRDL3
5. __transporter__, [OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we report the function of a rice (Oryza sativa) MATE gene (Os03g0216700, OsFRDL1), the closest homolog of barley (Hordeum vulgare) HvAACT1 (aluminum [Al]-activated citrate transporter 1), in terms of metal stress (iron [Fe] deficiency and Al toxicity)
6. __transporter__, [OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, our results indicate that OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter localized at the pericycle cells, which is necessary for efficient translocation of Fe to the shoot as a Fe-citrate complex
7. __transporter__, [OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice%5BTitle%5D), OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice
8. __root__, [OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Immunostaining showed that OsFRDL1 was localized at the pericycle cells of the roots
9. __iron__, [OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we report the function of a rice (Oryza sativa) MATE gene (Os03g0216700, OsFRDL1), the closest homolog of barley (Hordeum vulgare) HvAACT1 (aluminum [Al]-activated citrate transporter 1), in terms of metal stress (iron [Fe] deficiency and Al toxicity)
10. __iron__, [OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice%5BTitle%5D), OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice
11. __root__, [A rice FRD3-like (OsFRDL1) gene is expressed in the cells involved in long-distance transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice FRD3-like (OsFRDL1) gene is expressed in the cells involved in long-distance transport%5BTitle%5D),  Of these, we cloned three OsFRDL genes from a cDNA library prepared from iron-deficient rice roots: OsFRDL1, OsFRDL2, and OsFRDL3

13. __shoot__, [OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, our results indicate that OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter localized at the pericycle cells, which is necessary for efficient translocation of Fe to the shoot as a Fe-citrate complex

## Connection
1. __OsFRDL1__, __OsFRDL2__, [Functional analysis of a MATE gene OsFRDL2 revealed its involvement in Al-induced secretion of citrate, but less contribution to Al tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of a MATE gene OsFRDL2 revealed its involvement in Al-induced secretion of citrate, but less contribution to Al tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  A double mutant between osfrdl2 and osfrdl4 or osfrdl1 did not further decrease the Al-induced citrate secretion and Fe translocation compared with the single mutant
