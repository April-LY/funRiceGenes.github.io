## Publication
1. [Functional analysis of a MATE gene OsFRDL2 revealed its involvement in Al-induced secretion of citrate, but less contribution to Al tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional analysis of a MATE gene OsFRDL2 revealed its involvement in Al-induced secretion of citrate, but less contribution to Al tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2016, Plant Cell Physiol.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: OsFRDL2 was mainly expressed in the roots and its expression was not induced by Fe-deficiency, but rapidly up-regulated by Al |  Furthermore, the expression of OsFRDL2 was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type Zn-finger transcription factor for Al tolerance  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:
