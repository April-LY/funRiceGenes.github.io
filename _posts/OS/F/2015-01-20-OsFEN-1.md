## Key message
1. __leaf__, [Plant homologue of flap endonuclease-1: molecular cloning, characterization, and evidence of expression in meristematic tissues](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plant homologue of flap endonuclease-1: molecular cloning, characterization, and evidence of expression in meristematic tissues%5BTitle%5D)),  In the shoot apex, OsFEN-1 mRNA was abundant in the shoot apical meristem, tiller bud, leaf primordia, ligule primordia and marginal meristem of young leaves
2. __meristem__, [Plant homologue of flap endonuclease-1: molecular cloning, characterization, and evidence of expression in meristematic tissues](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plant homologue of flap endonuclease-1: molecular cloning, characterization, and evidence of expression in meristematic tissues%5BTitle%5D)),  OsFEN-1 transcripts were expressed strongly in proliferating tissues such as root tips and young leaves that contain root apical meristem and marginal meristem, respectively
3. __meristem__, [Plant homologue of flap endonuclease-1: molecular cloning, characterization, and evidence of expression in meristematic tissues](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plant homologue of flap endonuclease-1: molecular cloning, characterization, and evidence of expression in meristematic tissues%5BTitle%5D)),  In the shoot apex, OsFEN-1 mRNA was abundant in the shoot apical meristem, tiller bud, leaf primordia, ligule primordia and marginal meristem of young leaves
4. __root__, [Plant homologue of flap endonuclease-1: molecular cloning, characterization, and evidence of expression in meristematic tissues](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plant homologue of flap endonuclease-1: molecular cloning, characterization, and evidence of expression in meristematic tissues%5BTitle%5D)),  OsFEN-1 transcripts were expressed strongly in proliferating tissues such as root tips and young leaves that contain root apical meristem and marginal meristem, respectively
5. __shoot apical meristem__, [Plant homologue of flap endonuclease-1: molecular cloning, characterization, and evidence of expression in meristematic tissues](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plant homologue of flap endonuclease-1: molecular cloning, characterization, and evidence of expression in meristematic tissues%5BTitle%5D)),  In the shoot apex, OsFEN-1 mRNA was abundant in the shoot apical meristem, tiller bud, leaf primordia, ligule primordia and marginal meristem of young leaves
6. __root apical meristem__, [Plant homologue of flap endonuclease-1: molecular cloning, characterization, and evidence of expression in meristematic tissues](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plant homologue of flap endonuclease-1: molecular cloning, characterization, and evidence of expression in meristematic tissues%5BTitle%5D)),  OsFEN-1 transcripts were expressed strongly in proliferating tissues such as root tips and young leaves that contain root apical meristem and marginal meristem, respectively
7. __shoot__, [Plant homologue of flap endonuclease-1: molecular cloning, characterization, and evidence of expression in meristematic tissues](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plant homologue of flap endonuclease-1: molecular cloning, characterization, and evidence of expression in meristematic tissues%5BTitle%5D)),  In the shoot apex, OsFEN-1 mRNA was abundant in the shoot apical meristem, tiller bud, leaf primordia, ligule primordia and marginal meristem of young leaves
8. __tiller__, [Plant homologue of flap endonuclease-1: molecular cloning, characterization, and evidence of expression in meristematic tissues](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plant homologue of flap endonuclease-1: molecular cloning, characterization, and evidence of expression in meristematic tissues%5BTitle%5D)),  In the shoot apex, OsFEN-1 mRNA was abundant in the shoot apical meristem, tiller bud, leaf primordia, ligule primordia and marginal meristem of young leaves
9. __growth__, [Plant homologue of flap endonuclease-1: molecular cloning, characterization, and evidence of expression in meristematic tissues](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plant homologue of flap endonuclease-1: molecular cloning, characterization, and evidence of expression in meristematic tissues%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results indicate that OsFEN-1 is expressed in tissues rich in proliferating cells, and its expression may be required for cell growth and organ formation
