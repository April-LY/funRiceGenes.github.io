* **Key message**  
    + OsSPDS2 mRNA accumulated in roots during long term exposure to chilling temperature (12 degrees C)
    + Data suggested a distinct function of OsSPDS2 in chilling response in rice
    + ABA treatment up-regulated OsSPDS2, whereas salt stress did not change OsSPDS2 levels significantly
