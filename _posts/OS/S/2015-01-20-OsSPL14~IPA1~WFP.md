## Expression information
__Expression__:Enhanced expression of OsSPL14 gene and its association with yield components in rice (Oryza sativa) under low nitrogen conditions. |  Expression analysis of OsSPL14 (LOC_Os08g39890) gene reported to be associated with increased panicle branching and higher grain yield through real time PCR in leaf and three stages of panicle has shown differential temporal expression and its association with yield and yield related components across the genotypes |  The expression of OsSPL14 at panicle stage 3, has shown correlation (P&lt;0 |  Since OsSPL14 is a functional transcription activator, its association of expression in leaf and three panicle stages with yield components as observed in the present study suggests the role of nitrogen metabolism related genes in plant growth and development and its conversion into yield components in rice

## Connection
1. __Osmtd1__, __OsSPL14~IPA1~WFP__, [A T-DNA insertion mutant Osmtd1 aas altered in architecture by upregulating MicroRNA156f in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A T-DNA insertion mutant Osmtd1 aas altered in architecture by upregulating MicroRNA156f in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  We showed that the expression of OsSPL3, OsSPL12 and OsSPL14 was significantly down-regulated in Osmtd1 or OsmiR156f overexpressed lines, indicating that OsSPL3, OsSPL12 and OsSPL14 were possibly direct target genes of OsmiR156f
