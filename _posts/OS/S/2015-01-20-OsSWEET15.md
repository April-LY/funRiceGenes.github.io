* **Key message**  
    + SWEET11 and 15 as key players in seed filling in rice.
    + OsSWEET11 and 15 are essential for seed filling
    + The accumulation of starch in the pericarp of ossweet11 and ossweet11;15 double mutants supports the critical roles of OsSWEET11 and OsSWEET15 in sucrose translocation and mobilization towards the developing endosperm.
