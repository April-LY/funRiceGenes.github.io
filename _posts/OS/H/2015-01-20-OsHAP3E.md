2. __vegetative__, [Aberrant vegetative and reproductive development by overexpression and lethality by silencing of OsHAP3E in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Aberrant vegetative and reproductive development by overexpression and lethality by silencing of OsHAP3E in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The OsHAP3E-overexpressing plants were dwarf with erected leaves and similar to brassinosteroid mutants in the vegetative phase
3. __vegetative__, [Aberrant vegetative and reproductive development by overexpression and lethality by silencing of OsHAP3E in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Aberrant vegetative and reproductive development by overexpression and lethality by silencing of OsHAP3E in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Altogether, our loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses suggest that OsHAP3E plays important pleiotropic roles in vegetative and reproductive development or basic cellular processes in rice
