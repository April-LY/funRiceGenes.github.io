## Expression information
__Expression__:  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__: Moreover, phenotypic analysis of OsHKT1;4 RNAi plants in the vegetative growth stage revealed no profound influence on the growth and ion accumulation in comparison with WT plants upon salinity stress |  In addition, 22Na+ tracer experiments using peduncles of RNAi and WT plants suggested xylem Na+ unloading by OsHKT1;4

3. __leaf__, [A two-staged model of Na+ exclusion in rice explained by 3D modeling of HKT transporters and alternative splicing](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A two-staged model of Na+ exclusion in rice explained by 3D modeling of HKT transporters and alternative splicing%5BTitle%5D),  Thus, Na+ accumulation in a specific leaf blade seems to be regulated by abundance of a correctly spliced OsHKT1;4 transcript in a corresponding sheath
