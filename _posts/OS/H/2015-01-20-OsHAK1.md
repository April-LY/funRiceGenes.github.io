* **Key message**  
    + Expression of OsHAK1 is up-regulated by K deficiency or salt stress in various tissues, particularly in the root and shoot apical meristem, the epidermises and steles of root, and vascular bundles of shoot
    + Both oshak1 knockout mutants in comparison to their respective Dongjin or Manan wild types showed dramatically reduction in K concentration and stunted root and shoot growth
    + Knockout of OsHAK1 reduced the K absorption rate of unit root surface area by âˆ‘ù<U+3E63>50-55% and âˆ‘ù<U+3E63>30%, and total K uptake by âˆ‘ù<U+3E63>80% and âˆ‘ù<U+3E63>65% at 0
    + The root net high affinity K uptake of oshak1 mutants was sensitive to salt stress, but not to ammonium supply
    + Rice potassium transporter OsHAK1 is essential for maintaining potassium mediated growth and functions in salt tolerance over low and high potassium concentration ranges.
    + The positive relationship between K concentration and shoot biomass in the mutants suggests that OsHAK1 plays an essential role in K-mediated rice growth and salt tolerance over low and high K concentration ranges
