## Key message
1. __seedling__, [Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors%5BTitle%5D),  Notably, the expression of OsHXK5, OsHXK6, or their mutant alleles complemented the Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2-1 mutant, thereby resulting in wild-type characteristics in seedling development, Glc-dependent gene expression, and plant growth
2. __growth__, [Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors%5BTitle%5D),  Notably, the expression of OsHXK5, OsHXK6, or their mutant alleles complemented the Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2-1 mutant, thereby resulting in wild-type characteristics in seedling development, Glc-dependent gene expression, and plant growth

4. __mitochondria__, [Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors%5BTitle%5D),  Transient expression analyses using GFP fusion constructs revealed that OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 are associated with mitochondria
5. __mitochondria__, [Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors%5BTitle%5D),  Interestingly, the OsHXK5DeltamTP-GFP and OsHXK6DeltamTP-GFP fusion proteins, which lack N-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptides, were present mainly in the nucleus with a small amount of the proteins seen in the cytosol
6. __mitochondria__, [Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, the OsHXK5NLS-GFP and OsHXK6NLS-GFP fusion proteins harboring nuclear localization signals were targeted predominantly in the nucleus, suggesting that these OsHXKs retain a dual-targeting ability to mitochondria and nuclei
7. __seed__, [Structure, expression, and functional analysis of the hexokinase gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Structure, expression, and functional analysis of the hexokinase gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D),  Sugars induced the expression of three OsHXKs, OsHXK2, OsHXK5, and OsHXK6, in excised leaves, while suppressing OsHXK7 expression in excised leaves and immature seeds
