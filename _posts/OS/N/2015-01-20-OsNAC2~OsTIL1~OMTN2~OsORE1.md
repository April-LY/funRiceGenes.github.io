* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsNAC2 regulates shoot branching in rice
    + Overexpression of OsNAC2 contributes tiller bud outgrowth, but does not affect tiller bud initiation
    + Here, an activation-tagging mutant Ostil1 (Oryza sativa tillering1) was characterized, which showed increased tillers, enlarged tiller angle and semidwarf phenotype
    + This suggests that OsNAC2 has potential utility for improving plant structure for higher light-use efficiency and higher yield potential in rice
    + OsNAC2 encoding a NAC transcription factor affects plant height through mediating the gibberellic acid pathway in rice.
    + Taken together, we proposed that OsNAC2 is a negative regulator of the plant height and flowering time, which acts by directly regulating key genes of the GA pathway in rice
