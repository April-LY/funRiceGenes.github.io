* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsNAC2 regulates shoot branching in rice
    + Overexpression of OsNAC2 contributes tiller bud outgrowth, but does not affect tiller bud initiation
    + Here, an activation-tagging mutant Ostil1 (Oryza sativa tillering1) was characterized, which showed increased tillers, enlarged tiller angle and semidwarf phenotype
    + This suggests that OsNAC2 has potential utility for improving plant structure for higher light-use efficiency and higher yield potential in rice
    + OsNAC2 encoding a NAC transcription factor affects plant height through mediating the gibberellic acid pathway in rice.
    + Taken together, we proposed that OsNAC2 is a negative regulator of the plant height and flowering time, which acts by directly regulating key genes of the GA pathway in rice
    + With reduced yields under drought conditions at the flowering stage, OsNAC2 overexpression lines had lower resistance to high salt and drought conditions
    + The NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC2 regulates ABA-dependent genes and abiotic stress tolerance in rice.
    + We further confirmed that OsNAC2 directly binds the promoters of LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT 3 (OsLEA3) and Stress-Activated Protein Kinases 1 (OsSAPK1), two marker genes in the abiotic stress and ABA response pathways, respectively
    + Our results suggest that in rice OsNAC2 regulates both abiotic stress responses and ABA-mediated responses, and acts at the junction between the ABA and abiotic stress pathways
