## Key message
1. __transporter__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Map-based cloning revealed that all of the observed mutant phenotypes result from a missense mutation in a putative NST gene, Oryza sativa Nucleotide Sugar Transporter1 (OsNST1)
2. __transporter__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNST1 was identified as a Golgi-localized transporter by analysis of a fluorescence-tagged OsNST1 expressed in rice protoplast cells and demonstration of UDP-glucose transport activity via uptake assays in yeast
3. __growth__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The inferior mechanical strength and abnormal development of bc14 plants suggest that OsNST1 has pleiotropic effects on cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth
4. __cell wall__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The inferior mechanical strength and abnormal development of bc14 plants suggest that OsNST1 has pleiotropic effects on cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth
5. __cellulose__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Compositional sugar analyses in total and fractionated wall residues of wild-type and bc14 culms showed a deficiency in the synthesis of glucoconjugated polysaccharides in bc14, indicating that OsNST1 supplies the glucosyl substrate for the formation of matrix polysaccharides, and thereby modulates cellulose biosynthesis
6. __cellulose__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  A previously undescribed Golgi NST mutant, brittle culm14 (bc14), displays reduced mechanical strength caused by decreased cellulose content and altered wall structure, and exhibits abnormalities in plant development
7. __cellulose__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Compositional sugar analyses in total and fractionated wall residues of wild-type and bc14 culms showed a deficiency in the synthesis of glucoconjugated polysaccharides in bc14, indicating that OsNST1 supplies the glucosyl substrate for the formation of matrix polysaccharides, and thereby modulates cellulose biosynthesis
8. __cell wall__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The inferior mechanical strength and abnormal development of bc14 plants suggest that OsNST1 has pleiotropic effects on cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth
9. __cell wall__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Identification of OsNST1 has improved our understanding of how cell wall polysaccharide synthesis is regulated by Golgi NSTs in plants
10. __culm__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Compositional sugar analyses in total and fractionated wall residues of wild-type and bc14 culms showed a deficiency in the synthesis of glucoconjugated polysaccharides in bc14, indicating that OsNST1 supplies the glucosyl substrate for the formation of matrix polysaccharides, and thereby modulates cellulose biosynthesis
11. __cell wall__, [Golgi-localized UDP-glucose transporter is required for cell wall integrity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi-localized UDP-glucose transporter is required for cell wall integrity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We previously examined cell wall composition of bc14 and wild type plants
12. __culm__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  A previously undescribed Golgi NST mutant, brittle culm14 (bc14), displays reduced mechanical strength caused by decreased cellulose content and altered wall structure, and exhibits abnormalities in plant development
13. __culm__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Compositional sugar analyses in total and fractionated wall residues of wild-type and bc14 culms showed a deficiency in the synthesis of glucoconjugated polysaccharides in bc14, indicating that OsNST1 supplies the glucosyl substrate for the formation of matrix polysaccharides, and thereby modulates cellulose biosynthesis
