* **Key message**  
    + OsNIP3;1, a rice boric acid channel, regulates boron distribution and is essential for growth under boron-deficient conditions
    + GFP-tagged OsNIP3;1 expressed in tobacco BY2 cells was localized to the plasma membrane.
    + Promoter-GUS analysis suggested that OsNIP3;1 is expressed mainly in exodermal cells and steles in roots, as well as in cells around the vascular bundles in leaf sheaths and pericycle cells around the xylem in leaf blades.
