* **Key message**  
    + Transcription factor OsNF-YB9 regulates reproductive growth and development in rice.
    + OsNF-YB9 interacted with MADS1, a key regulator of floral development
    + OsNF-YB9 overexpression also resulted in morphological defects in the reproductive organs and led to pseudovivipary
    + OsNF-YB9 delayed the heading date when ectopically expressed in rice
