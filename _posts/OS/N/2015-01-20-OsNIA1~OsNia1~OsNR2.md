* **Key message**  
    + The indica nitrate reductase gene OsNR2 allele enhances rice yield potential and nitrogen use efficiency.
    + These properties enable indica OsNR2 to confer increased effective tiller number, grain yield and NUE on japonica rice, effects enhanced by interaction with an additionally introgressed indica OsNRT1
    + In consequence, indica OsNR2 provides an important breeding resource for the sustainable increases in japonica rice yields necessary for future global food security
