[The NF-YA transcription factor OsNF-YA7 confers drought stress tolerance of rice in an abscisic acid independent manner.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The NF-YA transcription factor OsNF-YA7 confers drought stress tolerance of rice in an abscisic acid independent manner.%5BTitle%5D), 2015, Plant Sci.

## Genbank accession number
[AK059903](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AK059903)  

## Expression information
__Expression__: Expression of OsNF-YA7 was induced by drought stress and its overexpression in transgenic rice plants improved their drought tolerance |  OsNF-YA4 expression was highly induced by the stress-related hormone abscisic acid ABA), while OsNF-YA7 was not, indicating that OsNF-YA7 mediates drought tolerance in an ABA-independent manner  
__OverExpression__: Expression of OsNF-YA7 was induced by drought stress and its overexpression in transgenic rice plants improved their drought tolerance  
__RNAi__:
