* **Key message**  
    + osnit1 and osnit2 displayed decreased primary root length and lateral root density
    + Both osnit1 and osnit2 showed root growth hypersensitivity to external ammonium; however, less root growth sensitivity to external IAN, higher expression of three IAA-amido synthetase (GH3) genes, and a lower rate of 3H-IAA movement towards the roots were observed
