## Information
__Symbol__: OsNF-YA4  
__MSU__: [LOC_Os03g48970](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g48970)

## Publication

[The NF-YA transcription factor OsNF-YA7 confers drought stress tolerance of rice in an abscisic acid independent manner.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The NF-YA transcription factor OsNF-YA7 confers drought stress tolerance of rice in an abscisic acid independent manner.%5BTitle%5D), 2015, Plant Sci.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: In contrast, OsNF-YA4 expression was not increased by drought stress and its overexpression in transgenic rice plants did not affect their sensitivity to drought stress |  OsNF-YA4 expression was highly induced by the stress-related hormone abscisic acid (ABA), while OsNF-YA7 was not, indicating that OsNF-YA7 mediates drought tolerance in an ABA-independent manner  
__OverExpression__: In contrast, OsNF-YA4 expression was not increased by drought stress and its overexpression in transgenic rice plants did not affect their sensitivity to drought stress  
__RNAi__:
