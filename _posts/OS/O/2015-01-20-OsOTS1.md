## Key message
1. __root__, [SUMO is a critical regulator of salt stress responses in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SUMO is a critical regulator of salt stress responses in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  We demonstrate that OsOTS1 confers salt tolerance in rice by increasing root biomass
2. __salinity__, [SUMO is a critical regulator of salt stress responses in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SUMO is a critical regulator of salt stress responses in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  High salinity triggers OsOTS1 degradation indicating that increased SUMO conjugation in rice plants during salt stress is in part achieved by down-regulation of OTS1/2 activity
3. __salt__, [SUMO is a critical regulator of salt stress responses in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SUMO is a critical regulator of salt stress responses in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  In this report, we reveal the Ubiquitin-like Protease ULP class of SUMO protease gene family in rice and demonstrate a critical role for OsOTS1 SUMO protease in salt stress
4. __salt__, [SUMO is a critical regulator of salt stress responses in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SUMO is a critical regulator of salt stress responses in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsOTS1 have increased salt tolerance and a concomitant reduction in the levels of SUMOylated proteins
5. __salt__, [SUMO is a critical regulator of salt stress responses in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SUMO is a critical regulator of salt stress responses in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  We demonstrate that OsOTS1 confers salt tolerance in rice by increasing root biomass

7. __salt__, [SUMO is a critical regulator of salt stress responses in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SUMO is a critical regulator of salt stress responses in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  OsOTS1 is nuclear localised indicating a direct requirement of OsOTS1 dependent deSUMOylation activity in rice nuclei for salt tolerance
8. __tolerance__, [SUMO is a critical regulator of salt stress responses in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=SUMO is a critical regulator of salt stress responses in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsOTS1 have increased salt tolerance and a concomitant reduction in the levels of SUMOylated proteins
