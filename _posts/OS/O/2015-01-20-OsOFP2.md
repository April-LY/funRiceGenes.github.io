## Key message
1. __leaf__, [Rice Ovate Family Protein 2 OFP2 alters hormonal homeostasis and vasculature development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice Ovate Family Protein 2 OFP2 alters hormonal homeostasis and vasculature development.%5BTitle%5D),  Rice plants overexpressing OsOFP2 were reduced in height and exhibited altered leaf morphology, seed shape, and positioning of vascular bundles in stems
2. __vascular bundle__, [Rice Ovate Family Protein 2 OFP2 alters hormonal homeostasis and vasculature development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice Ovate Family Protein 2 OFP2 alters hormonal homeostasis and vasculature development.%5BTitle%5D),  Rice plants overexpressing OsOFP2 were reduced in height and exhibited altered leaf morphology, seed shape, and positioning of vascular bundles in stems
3. __seed__, [Rice Ovate Family Protein 2 OFP2 alters hormonal homeostasis and vasculature development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice Ovate Family Protein 2 OFP2 alters hormonal homeostasis and vasculature development.%5BTitle%5D),  Rice plants overexpressing OsOFP2 were reduced in height and exhibited altered leaf morphology, seed shape, and positioning of vascular bundles in stems
