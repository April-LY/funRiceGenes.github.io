## Key message
1. __leaf rolling__, [Overexpression of OsZHD1, a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor, induces abaxially curled and drooping leaf in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of OsZHD1, a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor, induces abaxially curled and drooping leaf in rice%5BTitle%5D),  We herein reported OsZHD1 with key roles in rice morphogenesis, especially in the modulating of leaf rolling, which provided a novel insight into the molecular mechanism of leaf development in rice
2. __transcription factor__, [Overexpression of OsZHD1, a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor, induces abaxially curled and drooping leaf in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of OsZHD1, a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor, induces abaxially curled and drooping leaf in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The abaxially curled leaf phenotypes, co-segregating with the inserted transferred DNA, were caused by overexpression of a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor OsZHD1)  
3. __transcription factor__, [Overexpression of OsZHD1, a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor, induces abaxially curled and drooping leaf in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of OsZHD1, a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor, induces abaxially curled and drooping leaf in rice%5BTitle%5D), Overexpression of OsZHD1, a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor, induces abaxially curled and drooping leaf in rice
4. __leaf development__, [Overexpression of OsZHD1, a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor, induces abaxially curled and drooping leaf in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of OsZHD1, a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor, induces abaxially curled and drooping leaf in rice%5BTitle%5D),  We herein reported OsZHD1 with key roles in rice morphogenesis, especially in the modulating of leaf rolling, which provided a novel insight into the molecular mechanism of leaf development in rice
5. __leaf__, [Overexpression of OsZHD1, a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor, induces abaxially curled and drooping leaf in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of OsZHD1, a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor, induces abaxially curled and drooping leaf in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The abaxially curled leaf phenotypes, co-segregating with the inserted transferred DNA, were caused by overexpression of a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor OsZHD1)  
6. __leaf__, [Overexpression of OsZHD1, a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor, induces abaxially curled and drooping leaf in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of OsZHD1, a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor, induces abaxially curled and drooping leaf in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Artificial overexpression of OsZHD1 or its closest homolog OsZHD2 induced the abaxial leaf curling

9. __panicle__, [Overexpression of OsZHD1, a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor, induces abaxially curled and drooping leaf in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of OsZHD1, a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor, induces abaxially curled and drooping leaf in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsZHD1 exhibited a constitutive expression pattern in wild-type plants and accumulated in the developing leaves and panicles
