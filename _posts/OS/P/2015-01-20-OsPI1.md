## Key message
1. __phosphate__, [Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status%5BTitle%5D),  A novel gene was isolated by cDNA microarray analysis and designated as OsPI1 (Oryza sativaPhosphate-limitation Inducible Gene 1)
2. __phosphate__, [Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status%5BTitle%5D),  The OsPI1 gene was rapidly induced by phosphate starvation in both shoots and roots
3. __phosphate__, [Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status%5BTitle%5D),  When phosphate was supplied to phosphate-deficient plants, the OsPI1 transcripts rapidly disappeared
4. __phosphate__, [Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status%5BTitle%5D),  The OsPI1 gene shows the same characteristics as the TPSI1/Mt4 family (the phosphate starvation inducible novel gene family)
5. __phosphate__, [Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status%5BTitle%5D),  It is suggested that OsPI1 acts as riboregulator, that is, it binds with other molecules under phosphate starvation and regulates their function
6. __phosphorus__, [Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status%5BTitle%5D), Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status
7. __shoot__, [Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status%5BTitle%5D),  The OsPI1 gene was rapidly induced by phosphate starvation in both shoots and roots
8. __root__, [Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status%5BTitle%5D),  The OsPI1 gene was rapidly induced by phosphate starvation in both shoots and roots
9. __root__, [Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status%5BTitle%5D), Expression of the OsPI1 gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status
