## Key message
1. __leaf__, [Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice%5BTitle%5D),  RNA interference knockdown of OsPAO led to pheophorbide a accumulation in leaves especially dark-induced senescent leaves and leaf death from regeneration stage onwards, even transgenic plants inviability after transplantation
2. __senescence__, [Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that OsPAO and OsRCCR1 play key roles in senescence and are involved in wound responses

## Connection
1. __OsPAO__, __OsRCCR1__, [Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In this report, a single PAO gene OsPAO and two RCCR genes OsRCCR1 and OsRCCR2 have been isolated from rice
2. __OsPAO__, __OsRCCR1__, [Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that OsPAO and OsRCCR1 play key roles in senescence and are involved in wound responses
3. __OsPAO__, __OsRCCR1__, [Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice%5BTitle%5D), Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice
4. __OsPAO__, __SGR__, [Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice%5BTitle%5D),  SGR, like the gene for pheophorbide a oxygenase PaO), was constitutively expressed, but was upregulated by dark-induced senescence in rice leaves
5. __OsPAO__, __SGR__, [Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Senescence-induced expression of SGR and PaO was enhanced by ABA, but inhibited by cytokinin
6. __OsPAO__, __SGR__, [Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice%5BTitle%5D),  According to these observations, we propose that SGR may be involved in regulating or taking part in the activity of PaO, and then may influence Chl breakdown and degradation of pigment-protein complex
