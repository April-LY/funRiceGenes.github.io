## Key message
1. __chloroplast__, [Identification of a dual-targeted protein belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family that is required for early leaf development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification of a dual-targeted protein belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family that is required for early leaf development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsPAPST1 is highly expressed in young leaves and roots, while the expression is reduced in mature leaves, in line with the recovery of chloroplast development seen in the older leaves of papst1 mutant plants
2. __chloroplast__, [Identification of a dual-targeted protein belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family that is required for early leaf development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification of a dual-targeted protein belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family that is required for early leaf development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsPAPST1 is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane and chloroplast envelope
3. __root__, [Identification of a dual-targeted protein belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family that is required for early leaf development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification of a dual-targeted protein belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family that is required for early leaf development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsPAPST1 is highly expressed in young leaves and roots, while the expression is reduced in mature leaves, in line with the recovery of chloroplast development seen in the older leaves of papst1 mutant plants
4. __mitochondria__, [Identification of a dual-targeted protein belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family that is required for early leaf development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification of a dual-targeted protein belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family that is required for early leaf development in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsPAPST1 is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane and chloroplast envelope
