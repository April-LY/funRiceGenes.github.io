* **Key message**  
    + A substitution mutation in OsPELOTA confers bacterial blight resistance by activating the salicylic acid pathway.
    + Here, we report the map-based cloning of the causal gene OsPELOTA (originally termed splHM47 )
    + LML1 is expressed in all types of leaf cells, and encodes a novel eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
    + LML1 can partially rescue the growth delay phenotype of the LML1 yeast ortholog mutant, dom34
    + Both lml1 and mutants of AtLML1 (the LML1 Arabidopsis ortholog) exhibited a growth delay phenotype as dom34
    + The lml1 mutant exhibited abnormal cell death and resistance to both bacterial blight and rice blast
