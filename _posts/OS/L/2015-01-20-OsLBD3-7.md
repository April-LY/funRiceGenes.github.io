* **Key message**  
    + Microscopy of flag leaf cross-sections indicated that overexpression of OsLBD3-7 led to a decrease in both bulliform cell size and number
    + These results indicated that OsLBD3-7 might acts as an upstream regulatory gene of bulliform cell development to regulate leaf rolling, which will give more insights on the leaf rolling regulation mechanism
    + OsLBD3-7 works as a transcription activator and its protein is located on the plasma membrane and in the nucleus
