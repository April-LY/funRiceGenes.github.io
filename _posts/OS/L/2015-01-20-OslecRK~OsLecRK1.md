## Key message
1. __seed germination__, [A rice lectin receptor-like kinase that is involved in innate immune responses also contributes to seed germination](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A rice lectin receptor-like kinase that is involved in innate immune responses also contributes to seed germination%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we show that the rice lectin receptor-like kinase OslecRK contributes to both seed germination and plant innate immunity
2. __seed germination__, [A rice lectin receptor-like kinase that is involved in innate immune responses also contributes to seed germination](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A rice lectin receptor-like kinase that is involved in innate immune responses also contributes to seed germination%5BTitle%5D),  We demonstrate that knocking down the OslecRK gene depresses the expression of α–amylase genes, reducing seed viability and thereby decreasing the rate of seed germination
