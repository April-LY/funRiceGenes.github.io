9. __reproductive__, [Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains%5BTitle%5D),  In rice plants, strong OsLCT1 expression was observed in leaf blades and nodes during the reproductive stage
10. __growth__, [Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains%5BTitle%5D),  The content of other metals in rice grains and plant growth were not negatively affected by OsLCT1 suppression
11. __xylem__, [Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains%5BTitle%5D),  RNAi-mediated knockdown of OsLCT1 did not affect xylem-mediated Cd transport but reduced phloem-mediated Cd transport
12. __leaf__, [Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains%5BTitle%5D),  In rice plants, strong OsLCT1 expression was observed in leaf blades and nodes during the reproductive stage
13. __vascular bundle__, [Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains%5BTitle%5D),  In the uppermost node, OsLCT1 transcripts were detected around large vascular bundles and in diffuse vascular bundles
