* **Key message**  
    + To address the cross-talk of GA and ABA signaling, we studied two rice WRKY genes (OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY71) that are ABA-inducible and GA-repressible in embryos and aleurone cells
    + In contrast, the third non-DNA-binding mutant enhances GA induction of Amy32b-GUS, by interfering with the binding of the wild-type OsWRKY71 or the OsWRKY71/OsWRKY51 repressing complex
