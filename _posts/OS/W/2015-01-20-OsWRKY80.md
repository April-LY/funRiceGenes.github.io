* **Key message**  
    + We show that the putative WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY80 is up-regulated in rice leaves, stems and roots after Fe-excess treatment
    + " This up-regulation is also observed after dark-induced senescence and drought stress, indicating that OsWRKY80 could be a general stress-responsive gene"
    + We isolated 24 sequences which have putative functions in distinct cellular processes, such as transcription regulation (OsWRKY80), stress response (OsGAP1, DEAD-BOX RNA helicase), proteolysis (oryzain-alpha, rhomboid protein), photosynthesis (chlorophyll a/b binding protein), sugar metabolism (beta glucosidase) and electron transport (NADH ubiquinone oxireductase)
    + This up-regulation is also observed after dark-induced senescence and drought stress, indicating that OsWRKY80 could be a general stress-responsive gene
