__RNAi__:  

## Key message
1. __resistance__, [Several wall-associated kinases participate positively and negatively in basal defense against rice blast fungus.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Several wall-associated kinases participate positively and negatively in basal defense against rice blast fungus.%5BTitle%5D),  While OsWAK14, OsWAK91 and OsWAK92 positively regulate quantitative resistance, OsWAK112d is a negative regulator of blast resistance
