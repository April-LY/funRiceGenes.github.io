* **Key message**  
    + Inducible downregulation of OsWOX4 resulted in severe defects in leaf development, such as an arrest of vascular differentiation, a partial defect in the early cell proliferation required for midrib formation, and a failure to maintain cellular activity in general parenchyma cells
    + Transcriptome analysis further showed that OsWOX4 regulates multiple genes, including those responsible for cell cycle progression and hormone action, consistent with the effects of OsWOX4 downregulation on leaf phenotypes
    + Collectively, these results suggest that OsWOX4 acts as a key regulator at an early stage of leaf development
    + In situ analysis showed that knockdown of OsWOX4 reduced the expression of two LONELY GUY genes, which function in the synthesis of active cytokinin, in developing vascular bundles
    + Our previous work revealed that OsWOX4 is involved in the maintenance of shoot apical meristem in rice, whereas AtWOX4 is specifically associated with the maintenance of vascular stem cells in Arabidopsis
    + Consistent with this, cytokinin levels were downregulated by OsWOX4 knockdown
