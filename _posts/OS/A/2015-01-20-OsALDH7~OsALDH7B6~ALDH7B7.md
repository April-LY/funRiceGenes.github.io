## Expression information

## Key message
1. __seed development__, [Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability%5BTitle%5D),  These pigments started to accumulate in the late seed developmental stage, the time when OsALDH7 expression began to increase significantly
2. __endosperm__, [Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability%5BTitle%5D),  Interestingly, endosperms from the osaldh7 null mutants accumulated brown pigments during desiccation and storage
3. __blast__, [Molecular cloning and differential expression of an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene in rice leaves in response to infection by blast fungus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and differential expression of an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene in rice leaves in response to infection by blast fungus%5BTitle%5D),  Using diï¬€erential display RT-PCR and cDNA library screening, a full-length aldehyde dehydrogenase cDNA (ALDH7B7) was isolated from rice leaves infected by incompatible race of blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea
4. __blast__, [Molecular cloning and differential expression of an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene in rice leaves in response to infection by blast fungus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and differential expression of an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene in rice leaves in response to infection by blast fungus%5BTitle%5D),  ALDH7B7 expression was induced by blast fungus infection, ultraviolet, mechanical wound in rice leaves and was not detected in untreated rice organs
5. __blast__, [Molecular cloning and differential expression of an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene in rice leaves in response to infection by blast fungus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and differential expression of an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene in rice leaves in response to infection by blast fungus%5BTitle%5D),  The function of ALDH7B7 in the interaction process between blast fungus and rice is discussed
6. __seed__, [Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability%5BTitle%5D),  These pigments started to accumulate in the late seed developmental stage, the time when OsALDH7 expression began to increase significantly
7. __seed__, [Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that OsALDH7 is involved in removing various aldehydes formed by oxidative stress during seed desiccation
8. __seed__, [Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability%5BTitle%5D),  These data imply that OsALDH7 plays an important role in maintaining seed viability by detoxifying the aldehydes generated by lipid peroxidation
9. __endosperm__, [Mutation of OsALDH7 causes a yellow-colored endosperm associated with accumulation of oryzamutaic acid A in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutation of OsALDH7 causes a yellow-colored endosperm associated with accumulation of oryzamutaic acid A in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Here we reported a mutant with yellow-colored endosperm in rice, and showed that the yellow endosperm was caused by mutation of OsALDH7
10. __endosperm__, [Mutation of OsALDH7 causes a yellow-colored endosperm associated with accumulation of oryzamutaic acid A in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutation of OsALDH7 causes a yellow-colored endosperm associated with accumulation of oryzamutaic acid A in rice%5BTitle%5D), Mutation of OsALDH7 causes a yellow-colored endosperm associated with accumulation of oryzamutaic acid A in rice
11. __abiotic stress__, [Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability%5BTitle%5D), " We obtained T-DNA insertional mutants in OsALDH7, which is remarkably inducible by oxidative and abiotic stresses"
12. __seed__, [Mutation of OsALDH7 causes a yellow-colored endosperm associated with accumulation of oryzamutaic acid A in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutation of OsALDH7 causes a yellow-colored endosperm associated with accumulation of oryzamutaic acid A in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsALDH7 is expressed in all tissues detected, with the highest level in mature seeds
13. __oxidative__, [Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability%5BTitle%5D), " We obtained T-DNA insertional mutants in OsALDH7, which is remarkably inducible by oxidative and abiotic stresses
14. __oxidative__, [Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that OsALDH7 is involved in removing various aldehydes formed by oxidative stress during seed desiccation"
