## Expression information

## Key message
1. __root__, [Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  It is reported here that OsA8, a typical PM H+-ATPases gene that was predominantly expressed in roots of rice, is down-regulated by nutrient deficiency
2. __root__, [Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The Osa8 mutant had a relatively smaller size and root to shoot biomass ratio, but higher ATPase activity than its wild-type counterparts under phosphorus P starvation conditions
3. __root__, [Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Knockout of OsA8 affected the expression of several OsA genes and the high affinity phosphate transporter, OsPT6, and resulted in a higher P concentration in the roots and a lower amount of P in the shoots
4. __root__, [Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These analyses demonstrate that OsA8 not only influences the uptake of P by roots, but also the translocation of P from the roots to the shoots in rice
5. __phosphorus__, [Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The Osa8 mutant had a relatively smaller size and root to shoot biomass ratio, but higher ATPase activity than its wild-type counterparts under phosphorus P starvation conditions
6. __phosphorus__, [Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice%5BTitle%5D), Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice
7. __biomass__, [Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The Osa8 mutant had a relatively smaller size and root to shoot biomass ratio, but higher ATPase activity than its wild-type counterparts under phosphorus P starvation conditions
8. __transporter__, [Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Knockout of OsA8 affected the expression of several OsA genes and the high affinity phosphate transporter, OsPT6, and resulted in a higher P concentration in the roots and a lower amount of P in the shoots
9. __phosphate__, [Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Knockout of OsA8 affected the expression of several OsA genes and the high affinity phosphate transporter, OsPT6, and resulted in a higher P concentration in the roots and a lower amount of P in the shoots
10. __shoot__, [Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The Osa8 mutant had a relatively smaller size and root to shoot biomass ratio, but higher ATPase activity than its wild-type counterparts under phosphorus P starvation conditions
11. __shoot__, [Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Knockout of OsA8 affected the expression of several OsA genes and the high affinity phosphate transporter, OsPT6, and resulted in a higher P concentration in the roots and a lower amount of P in the shoots
12. __shoot__, [Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These analyses demonstrate that OsA8 not only influences the uptake of P by roots, but also the translocation of P from the roots to the shoots in rice
