* **Key message**  
    + Disruption of OsAKT2 results in delayed growth of rice seedlings under short-day conditions
    + Here, we identified the rice OsAKT2 as the ortholog of Arabidopsis AtAKT2, which is primarily expressed in the shoot phloem and localized at the plasma membrane
    + Phosphatidic acid directly binds with rice potassium channel OsAKT2 to inhibit its activity.
