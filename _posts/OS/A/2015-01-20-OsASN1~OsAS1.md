* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + OsAS1 was mainly expressed in the roots with in situ hybridization showing that the corresponding mRNA was specifically accumulated in the three cell layers of root surface (epidermis, exodermis, and sclerenchyma) in an NH4 (+)-dependent manner
