## Key message
1. __abiotic stress__, [A new DEAD-box helicase ATP-binding protein OsABP from rice is responsive to abiotic stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A new DEAD-box helicase ATP-binding protein OsABP from rice is responsive to abiotic stress%5BTitle%5D), " In the present study, we report on the identification of a new DEAD-box helicase ATP-binding protein OsABP from rice which is upregulated in response e to multiple abiotic stress treatments including NaCl, dehydration, ABA, blue and red light
2. __abiotic stress__, [A new DEAD-box helicase ATP-binding protein OsABP from rice is responsive to abiotic stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A new DEAD-box helicase ATP-binding protein OsABP from rice is responsive to abiotic stress%5BTitle%5D),  These results imply that OsABP might perform important functions in the cellular response to specific abiotic stress
