## Key message
1. __root__, [Identification of a novel iron regulated basic helix-loop-helix protein involved in Fe homeostasis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification of a novel iron regulated basic helix-loop-helix protein involved in Fe homeostasis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  RESULTS: Transcript abundance of one nuclear located basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factor, OsIRO3, is up-regulated from 25- to 90-fold under Fe deficiency in both root and shoot respectively
2. __transcription factor__, [Identification of a novel iron regulated basic helix-loop-helix protein involved in Fe homeostasis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification of a novel iron regulated basic helix-loop-helix protein involved in Fe homeostasis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  RESULTS: Transcript abundance of one nuclear located basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factor, OsIRO3, is up-regulated from 25- to 90-fold under Fe deficiency in both root and shoot respectively
3. __transcription factor__, [Identification of a novel iron regulated basic helix-loop-helix protein involved in Fe homeostasis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification of a novel iron regulated basic helix-loop-helix protein involved in Fe homeostasis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  CONCLUSION: A novel Fe regulated bHLH transcription factor (OsIRO3) that plays an important role for Fe homeostasis in rice was identified
4. __homeostasis__, [Identification of a novel iron regulated basic helix-loop-helix protein involved in Fe homeostasis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification of a novel iron regulated basic helix-loop-helix protein involved in Fe homeostasis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  CONCLUSION: A novel Fe regulated bHLH transcription factor (OsIRO3) that plays an important role for Fe homeostasis in rice was identified
