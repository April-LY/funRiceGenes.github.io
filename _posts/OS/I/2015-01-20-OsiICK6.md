1. __seed__, [Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development%5BTitle%5D),  Over-expression of OsiICK6 resulted in multiple phenotypic effects on plant growth, morphology, pollen viability and seed setting
2. __growth__, [Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development%5BTitle%5D),  Over-expression of OsiICK6 resulted in multiple phenotypic effects on plant growth, morphology, pollen viability and seed setting
3. __growth__, [Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development%5BTitle%5D),  In OsiICK6-over-expressing plants, leaves rolled toward the abaxial side, suggesting that cell proliferation is critical in maintaining an even growth along the dorsal-ventral plane of leaf blades

1. __OsiICK1__, __OsiICK6__, [Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development%5BTitle%5D),  KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Based on putative protein sequences, the six OsiICKs are grouped into two classes, with OsiICK1 and OsiICK6 in each of the two classes, respectively
2. __OsiICK1__, __OsiICK6__, [Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development%5BTitle%5D),  Results showed that OsiICK1 and OsiICK6 interacted with OsCYCD, but differed in their interactions with CDKA
3. __OsiICK1__, __OsiICK6__, [Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development%5BTitle%5D),  Both EGFP:OsiICK1 and EGFP:OsiICK6 were localized in the nucleus
