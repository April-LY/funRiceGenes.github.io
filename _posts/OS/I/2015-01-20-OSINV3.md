* **Key message**  
    + Further, strong promoter::GUS expression was observed in the palea, lemma and the rachis branches in the young elongating panicles, which supported the role of OsINV3 in cell expansion and thus, in spikelet size and panicle length determination
    + OsINV3 was found to regulate spikelet size by playing a key role in cell expansion, driving the movement of assimilates for grain filling by modulating the hexose-to-sucrose ratio, contributing in grain weight determination and thus, the grain yield
    + In addition, strong promoter::GUS expression was observed in the dorsal end of ovary during the pre-storage phase until 6<U+00A0>days after flowering, highlighting a function for OsINV3 in monitoring the initial grain filling stage
    + OsINV3 mutants showed shorter panicles with lighter and smaller grains, owing to a smaller cell size on the outer and inner surfaces of the palea and lemma as observed by scanning electron microscopy
