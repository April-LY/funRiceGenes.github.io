* **Key message**  
    + RESULTS: Transcript abundance of one nuclear located basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factor, OsIRO3, is up-regulated from 25- to 90-fold under Fe deficiency in both root and shoot respectively
    + CONCLUSION: A novel Fe regulated bHLH transcription factor (OsIRO3) that plays an important role for Fe homeostasis in rice was identified
    + Furthermore, the Fe concentration in shoots of transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsIRO3 was less than that in wild-type plants

    + __OsIRO3~OsOsbHLH063__, __OsPRI1~OsbHLH115__, [POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Collectively, these results imply that OsPRI1, which is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1, mediates rice responses to Fe-deficiency by positively regulating OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 expression as part of the OsHRZ1-OsPRI1-OsIRO2/3 signal transduction cascade
    + __OsbHLH59~OsbHLH059~OsPRI3__, __OsIRO3~OsOsbHLH063__, [Oryza sativa POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON DEFICIENCY RESPONSE 2 OsPRI2 and OsPRI3 are involved in the maintenance of Fe homeostasis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Oryza sativa POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON DEFICIENCY RESPONSE 2 OsPRI2 and OsPRI3 are involved in the maintenance of Fe homeostasis.%5BTitle%5D),  We also provide evidence that OsPRI2 and OsPRI3 bind to the promoters of OsIRO2 and OsIRO3, two key regulators of Fe homeostasis
