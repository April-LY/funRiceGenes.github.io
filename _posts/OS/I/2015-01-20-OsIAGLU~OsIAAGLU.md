* **Key message**  
    + The OsIAGLU gene driven by the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter was transformed into a rice cultivar to generate transgenic rice plants constitutively over-expressing this gene
    + To decrease IAA levels, we selected the rice IAA-glucose synthase gene (OsIAGLU) from the rice genome database based on high sequence homology with IAA-glucose synthase from maize (ZmIAGLU), which is known to generate IAAglucose conjugate from free IAA
    + Tiller formation in rice is altered by overexpression of OsIAGLU gene encoding an IAA-conjugating enzyme or exogenous treatment of free IAA
    + The number of tillers and leaf angle was significantly increased with a concomitant decrease in plant height and panicle length in the transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsIAAGLU compared to the wild-type (WT) plants
    + Furthermore, overexpression of OsIAAGLU resulted in reduced sensitivity to IAA/NAA and altered gravitropic response of the roots in the transgenic plants
    + Overexpression of OsIAAGLU in rice resulted in altered rice shoot architecture and root gravitropism
    + These results support that OsIAAGLU could play a regulatory role in IAA homeostasis and rice architecture
    + OsIAAGLU could catalyze the reaction of IAA with glucose to generate IAA-glucose
    + Expression of OsIAAGLU could be induced by IAA and NAA
    + Overexpression of OsIAAGLU reveals a role for IAA-glucose conjugation in modulating rice plant architecture.
