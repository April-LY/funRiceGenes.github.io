## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Transgenic overexpression of OsJAC1 in rice resulted in quantitative broad-spectrum resistance against different pathogens including bacteria, oomycetes and fungi |  Both protein domains of OsJAC1 are required to establish resistance as indicated by single or combined transient expression of individual domains  
__Expression__:Overexpression of OsJAC1, a Lectin Gene, Suppresses the Coleoptile and Stem Elongation in Rice |  Here we cloned the promoter of OsJAC1, and GUS activity was detected in young roots, coleoptiles, sheaths, leaves, nodes of stems, stems, rachises, pistils, stamens and lemmas of OsJAC1::GUS transgenic rice, suggesting that OsJAC1 is a constitutive expression gene in rice |  In addition, compared with coleoptiles of wild-type plants, those of OsJAC1 overexpression rice were more sensitive to JA treatment  
__OverExpression__: Transgenic overexpression of OsJAC1 in rice resulted in quantitative broad-spectrum resistance against different pathogens including bacteria, oomycetes and fungi  
__OverExpression__:Overexpression of OsJAC1, a Lectin Gene, Suppresses the Coleoptile and Stem Elongation in Rice |  In addition, compared with coleoptiles of wild-type plants, those of OsJAC1 overexpression rice were more sensitive to JA treatment
