1. __root__, [Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  Results show that OsRacB transcription is highly accumulated in roots after treatment with salinity, but only slightly accumulated in stems and leaves under the same treatment
2. __stem__, [Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  Results show that OsRacB transcription is highly accumulated in roots after treatment with salinity, but only slightly accumulated in stems and leaves under the same treatment
3. __blast__, [Functional characterization of OsRacB GTPase--a potentially negative regulator of basal disease resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional characterization of OsRacB GTPase--a potentially negative regulator of basal disease resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  A dramatic down-regulation in the OsRacB transcripts was also found in plants inoculated with the blast pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea
4. __blast__, [Functional characterization of OsRacB GTPase--a potentially negative regulator of basal disease resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional characterization of OsRacB GTPase--a potentially negative regulator of basal disease resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Interestingly, transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsRacB showed increased symptom development in response to rice blast pathogens
5. __salt__, [Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling%5BTitle%5D)), " In this study, we focus on the relationship between the novel rice Rop gene OsRacB and plant salt tolerance
6. __salt__, [Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  This suggests that overexpression of OsRacB in tobacco and rice can improve plant salt tolerance
7. __salt__, [Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  The results indicated that OsRacB is only an accessory factor in plant salt tolerance
