## Key message
1. __pollen__, [OsRAD21-3, an orthologue of yeast RAD21, is required for pollen development in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsRAD21-3, an orthologue of yeast RAD21, is required for pollen development in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  OsRAD21-3-deficient RNAi lines showed arrested pollen mitosis, aberrant pollen chromosome segregation and aborted pollen grains, which led to disrupted pollen viability
2. __pollen__, [OsRAD21-3, an orthologue of yeast RAD21, is required for pollen development in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsRAD21-3, an orthologue of yeast RAD21, is required for pollen development in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  However, male meiosis in these RNAi lines did not appear to be severely disrupted, which suggests that the main involvement of OsRAD21-3 is in post-meiotic pollen development by affecting pollen mitosis
3. __pollen__, [OsRAD21-3, an orthologue of yeast RAD21, is required for pollen development in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsRAD21-3, an orthologue of yeast RAD21, is required for pollen development in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, of the four OsRAD21 genes in the rice genome, only OsRAD21-3 was expressed in pollen grains

5. __meiotic__, [OsRAD21-3, an orthologue of yeast RAD21, is required for pollen development in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsRAD21-3, an orthologue of yeast RAD21, is required for pollen development in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  However, male meiosis in these RNAi lines did not appear to be severely disrupted, which suggests that the main involvement of OsRAD21-3 is in post-meiotic pollen development by affecting pollen mitosis

9. __vegetative__, [OsRAD21-3, an orthologue of yeast RAD21, is required for pollen development in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsRAD21-3, an orthologue of yeast RAD21, is required for pollen development in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  OsRAD21-3 transcript and protein accumulated preferentially in flowers, with low levels in vegetative tissues
10. __flower__, [OsRAD21-3, an orthologue of yeast RAD21, is required for pollen development in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsRAD21-3, an orthologue of yeast RAD21, is required for pollen development in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D),  OsRAD21-3 transcript and protein accumulated preferentially in flowers, with low levels in vegetative tissues
