## Key message
1. __panicle__, [Four receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases regulate development and immunity in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Four receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases regulate development and immunity in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic plants silenced for OsRLCK57 had significantly fewer tillers and reduced panicle secondary branching, and lines silenced for OsRLCK107 and OsRLCK118 produce fewer seeds
