    + OsRap2.6 transcription factor contributes to rice innate immunity through its interaction with Receptor for Activated Kinase-C 1 (RACK1)
    + An ERF transcription factor OsERF101 is predominantly expressed in rice reproductive tissues and plays an important role in improving rice seed setting rate under drought stress
    + OsERF101 was predominantly expressed in flowers, particularly in the tapetum and microspores under normal growth conditions
    + In this study, we identified a gene named OsERF101 as an important positive regulator in the adaptive responses to dehydration stress during the reproductive and vegetative stages
    + Taken together, our results indicate that OsERF101 is a gene that regulates dehydration responses during the vegetative and reproductive stages
