## Key message
1. __zinc__, [OsMT1a, a type 1 metallothionein, plays the pivotal role in zinc homeostasis and drought tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsMT1a, a type 1 metallothionein, plays the pivotal role in zinc homeostasis and drought tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Both transgenic plants and yeasts harboring OsMT1a accumulated more Zn2+ than wild type controls, suggesting OsMT1a is most likely to be involved in zinc homeostasis
2. __zinc__, [OsMT1a, a type 1 metallothionein, plays the pivotal role in zinc homeostasis and drought tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsMT1a, a type 1 metallothionein, plays the pivotal role in zinc homeostasis and drought tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, the transcripts of several Zn2+-induced CCCH zinc finger transcription factors accumulated in OsMT1a transgenic plants, suggesting that OsMT1a not only participates directly in ROS scavenging pathway but also regulates expression of the zinc finger transcription factors via the alteration of Zn2+ homeostasis, which leads to improved plant stress tolerance
