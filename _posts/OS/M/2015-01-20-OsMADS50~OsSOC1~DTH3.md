## Expression information

## Key message
1. __heading date__, [Functional analyses of the flowering time gene OsMADS50, the putative SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1/AGAMOUS-LIKE 20 (SOC1/AGL20) ortholog in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analyses of the flowering time gene OsMADS50, the putative SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1/AGAMOUS-LIKE 20 (SOC1/AGL20) ortholog in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  RT-PCR analyses of the OsMADS50 KO and ubiquitin (ubi):OsMADS50 plants showed that OsMADS50 is an upstream regulator of OsMADS1, OsMADS14, OsMADS15, OsMADS18, and Hd (Heading date)3a, but works either parallel with or downstream of Hd1 and O
2. __floral__, [Functional analyses of the flowering time gene OsMADS50, the putative SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1/AGAMOUS-LIKE 20 (SOC1/AGL20) ortholog in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analyses of the flowering time gene OsMADS50, the putative SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1/AGAMOUS-LIKE 20 (SOC1/AGL20) ortholog in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that OsMADS50 is an important flowering activator that controls various floral regulators in rice
3. __flower__, [OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We previously reported that OsMADS50, which is highly homologous to Arabidopsis SOC1, functions as a positive regulator for flowering
4. __flower__, [OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Knock-out of OsMADS50 caused a late-flowering phenotype only under LD conditions
5. __flower__, [OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These observations imply that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1-Ehd1 in regulating LD-dependent flowering
6. __flower__, [OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)), OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice
7. __flowering time__, [Distinct regulatory role for RFL, the rice LFY homolog, in determining flowering time and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Distinct regulatory role for RFL, the rice LFY homolog, in determining flowering time and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  In these transgenics, the expression levels of known flowering time genes reveal RFL as a regulator of OsSOC1 (OsMADS50), an activator of flowering
8. __floral__, [Reciprocal control of flowering time by OsSOC1 in transgenic Arabidopsis and by FLC in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Reciprocal control of flowering time by OsSOC1 in transgenic Arabidopsis and by FLC in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsSOC1 is expressed in vegetative tissues, and expression is elevated at the time of floral initiation, 40-50 days after sowing, and remains uniformly high thereafter, similar to the expression pattern of AtSOC1
9. __heading date__, [Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3%5BTitle%5D)),  Among them, the OsMADS50 and Heading date1 pathways were not affected by the mutation
10. __heading date__, [Heading date gene, dth3 controlled late flowering in O. Glaberrima Steud. by down-regulating Ehd1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heading date gene, dth3 controlled late flowering in O. Glaberrima Steud. by down-regulating Ehd1%5BTitle%5D)),  By analyzing a large F2 population from NIL x DJY1, the locus DTH3 (QTL for days to heading on chromosome 3) controlling early heading date in DJY1 was fine mapped to a 64-kb segment which contained only one annotated gene, a MIKC-type MADS-box protein
11. __heading date__, [Heading date gene, dth3 controlled late flowering in O. Glaberrima Steud. by down-regulating Ehd1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heading date gene, dth3 controlled late flowering in O. Glaberrima Steud. by down-regulating Ehd1%5BTitle%5D)),  The Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) which promotes the RFT1, was up-regulated by DTH3 in both LD and SD conditions
12. __heading date__, [Heading date gene, dth3 controlled late flowering in O. Glaberrima Steud. by down-regulating Ehd1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heading date gene, dth3 controlled late flowering in O.

14. __flower__, [Reciprocal control of flowering time by OsSOC1 in transgenic Arabidopsis and by FLC in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Reciprocal control of flowering time by OsSOC1 in transgenic Arabidopsis and by FLC in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The constitutive expression of OsSOC1 in Arabidopsis results in early flowering, suggesting that the rice gene is a functional equivalent of AtSOC1
15. __flower__, [Reciprocal control of flowering time by OsSOC1 in transgenic Arabidopsis and by FLC in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Reciprocal control of flowering time by OsSOC1 in transgenic Arabidopsis and by FLC in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We were not able to identify FLC-like sequences in the rice genome; however, we show that ectopic expression of the Arabidopsis FLC delays flowering in rice, and the up-regulation of OsSOC1 at the onset of flowering initiation is delayed in the AtFLC transgenic lines
16. __flower__, [Reciprocal control of flowering time by OsSOC1 in transgenic Arabidopsis and by FLC in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Reciprocal control of flowering time by OsSOC1 in transgenic Arabidopsis and by FLC in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)), Reciprocal control of flowering time by OsSOC1 in transgenic Arabidopsis and by FLC in transgenic rice

18. __flower__, [A gene network for long-day flowering activates RFT1 encoding a mobile flowering signal in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A gene network for long-day flowering activates RFT1 encoding a mobile flowering signal in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We propose that both positive (OsMADS50 and Ehd1) and negative (Hd1, phyB and Ghd7) regulators of RFT1 form a gene network that regulates LD flowering in rice
19. __heading date__, [OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of Hd3a and FTL decreased in these transgenic plants, whereas the expression of Hd1, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), OsMADS51, and OsMADS50 did not significantly change

Glaberrima Steud. by down-regulating Ehd1%5BTitle%5D)),  We detected a 6-bp deletion and a single base substitution in the C-domain by sequencing DTH3 in DJY1 compared with dth3 in NIL, and overexpression of DTH3 caused early flowering in callus
23. __flower__, [Heading date gene, dth3 controlled late flowering in O. Glaberrima Steud. by down-regulating Ehd1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heading date gene, dth3 controlled late flowering in O. Glaberrima Steud. by down-regulating Ehd1%5BTitle%5D)),  DTH3 affected flowering time and had no significant effect on the main agronomic traits
