* **Key message**  
    + OsMYB80 regulates anther development and pollen fertility by targeting multiple biological pathways.
    + To understand how OsMYB80 regulates anther development, RNA-seq analysis was conducted to identify genes differentially regulated by OsMYB80 in rice anthers
    + The osmyb80 mutants exhibited premature tapetum cell death, lack of Ubisch bodies, no exine, and microspore degeneration
    + Here we isolated two allelic male sterile mutants of OsMYB80 and investigated how OsMYB80 regulates male fertility in rice
    + Functional annotation of the 188 genes suggested that OsMYB80 regulates male fertility by directly targeting multiple biological processes
