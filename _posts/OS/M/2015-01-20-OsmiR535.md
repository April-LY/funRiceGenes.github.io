* **Key message**  
    + The multiple roles of OsmiR535 in modulating plant height, panicle branching and grain shape.
    + Furthermore, OsmiR535 overexpression imposed great influence in panicle architecture, such as more but shorter panicles, and fewer primary/secondary panicle branches
    + Through quantitative real-time PCR analyses, we further revealed that OsmiR535 overexpression repressed the expression of OsSPL7/12/16, as well as the OsSPLs downstream panicle related genes, including OsPIN1B, OsDEP1, OsLOG and OsSLR1
    + Taken together, our findings suggest that OsmiR535 multiply modulates plant height, panicle architecture and grain shape possibly by regulating OsSPLs genes in rice
    + Moreover, OsmiR535 overexpression increased the grain length, but did not affect grain width
    + Expectedly, OsmiR535 overexpression in rice reduced plant height by decreasing the 1st and 2nd internode length
