## Key message
1. __sterile__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  The synaptonemal complex is well installed in Osmsh5, while the chiasma frequency is greatly reduced to approximately 10% of that observed in the wild-type, leading to the homologous non-disjunction and complete sterile phenotype
2. __meiotic__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  Immunofluorescence studies indicate that OsMSH5 chromosomal localization is limited to the early meiotic prophase I
3. __meiotic__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10
4. __meiosis__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D),  Here, we report the identification and characterization of its rice homolog, OsMSH5, and demonstrate its function in rice meiosis
