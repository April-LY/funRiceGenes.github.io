## Key message
1. __cellulose__, [OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D),  A decrease in cellulose content but the increase in pectin and starch contents was identified in Osbc1l4 mutants by measuring the content of wall components
2. __cellulose__, [OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Correlation analysis indicated that the expression of OsBC1L4 was highly correlated to that of several primary wall-forming cellulose synthase genes CESAs)  
3. __cellulose__, [OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, the expression level of several cellulose-related genes is increased in Osbc1l4 mutants, which suggests that a feedback mechanism may exist during cellulose synthesis
4. __cellulose__, [OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D), OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice
5. __tiller__, [OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Previously, a dwarf mutant with fewer tillers, Osbc1l4 Oryza sativa brittle culm 1 like 4), was identified by screening a rice T-DNA insertion mutant library
6. __cell wall__, [OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D),  OsBC1L4 protein is mainly located in the cell wall and plasma membrane
7. __dwarf__, [OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Previously, a dwarf mutant with fewer tillers, Osbc1l4 Oryza sativa brittle culm 1 like 4), was identified by screening a rice T-DNA insertion mutant library
8. __starch__, [OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D),  A decrease in cellulose content but the increase in pectin and starch contents was identified in Osbc1l4 mutants by measuring the content of wall components
9. __culm__, [OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Previously, a dwarf mutant with fewer tillers, Osbc1l4 Oryza sativa brittle culm 1 like 4), was identified by screening a rice T-DNA insertion mutant library
