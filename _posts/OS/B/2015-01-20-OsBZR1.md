* **Key message**  
    + These results demonstrate a conserved function of OsBZR1 and an important role of 14-3-3 proteins in brassinosteroid signal transduction in rice
    + Functions of OsBZR1 and 14-3-3 proteins in brassinosteroid signaling in rice
    + To understand the downstream BR signaling mechanism in rice, we studied the function of OsBZR1 using reverse genetic approaches and identified OsBZR1-interacting proteins
    + Suppressing OsBZR1 expression by RNAi resulted in dwarfism, erect leaves, reduced BR sensitivity, and altered BR-responsive gene expression in transgenic rice plants, demonstrating an essential role of OsBZR1 in BR responses in rice
    + Finally, consistent with the fact that DLT is also negatively feedback-regulated by BR treatment, a gel mobility shift assay showed that OsBZR1 can bind to the DLT promoter through the BR-response element

    + __LIC~OsLIC1__, __OsBZR1__, [Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The gain-of-function mutant lic-1 and LIC-overexpressing lines showed erect leaves, similar to BZR1-depleted lines, which indicates the opposite roles of LIC and BZR1 in regulating leaf bending
    + __LIC~OsLIC1__, __OsBZR1__, [Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice%5BTitle%5D),  For negative feedback, LIC bound to the core element CTCGC in the BZR1 promoter on gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and repressed its transcription on transient transformation assay

    + __LIC~OsLIC1__, __OsBZR1__, [Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Molecular and physiology assays revealed that LIC plays a dominant role at high BR levels, whereas BZR1 is dominant at low levels
