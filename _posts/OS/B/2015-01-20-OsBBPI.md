## Key message
1. __jasmonic__, [Characterization of a rice Oryza sativa L.

Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors%5BTitle%5D),  OsBBPI was found to be rapidly induced in rice seedling leaf in response to cut, exogenous jasmonic acid JA), and two potent protein phosphatase 2A PP2A inhibitors, cantharidin CN and endothall EN), in a light/dark-, time- and dose-dependent manner; this induction was completely inhibited by cycloheximide CHX), indicating a requirement for de novo protein synthesis in its induction
2. __seedling__, [Characterization of a rice Oryza sativa L.

3. __salicylic acid__, [Characterization of a rice Oryza sativa L.

Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors%5BTitle%5D),  However, a simultaneous application of salicylic acid SA and abscisic acid ABA), with JA, respectively, completely blocked OsBBPI gene expression, whereas kinetin KN was only partially effective
4. __leaf__, [Characterization of a rice Oryza sativa L. Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of a rice Oryza sativa L.

Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors%5BTitle%5D),  Taken together, these results suggest that among the phytohormones tested here, JA and ethylene play important roles in regulating OsBBPI expression, with an intimate interaction with light signals
6. __phytohormone__, [Characterization of a rice Oryza sativa L. Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of a rice Oryza sativa L.

Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors%5BTitle%5D),  Besides JA, it was found that the ethylene generator ethephon ET also had an enhancing effect on OsBBPI transcript, suggesting a direct effect of ethylene on OsBBPI expression
8. __ethylene__, [Characterization of a rice Oryza sativa L. Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of a rice Oryza sativa L.

9. __ ABA __, [Characterization of a rice Oryza sativa L. Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of a rice Oryza sativa L. Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors%5BTitle%5D),  To the best of our knowledge, complete inhibition of JA-induced OsBBPI expression by SA is the first report in monocots, and with ABA in plants
10. __jasmonic acid__, [Characterization of a rice Oryza sativa L. Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Characterization of a rice Oryza sativa L.
