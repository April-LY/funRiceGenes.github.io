* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, transcriptional analysis revealed that mechanical wounding and treatment with MeJA resulted in an obvious increase in transcript levels of OsbHLH59 and OsERF71 in root and shoot tissues
    + OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 transcription factors positively regulate iron deficiency responses in rice.
    + Subgroup IVc basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 positively regulate major iron deficiency responses in rice in a similar but distinct manner, putatively under partial control by OsHRZs
    + In the present study, we investigated the functions of OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 related to iron deficiency response
    + OsbHLH059 knockdown lines were also susceptible to iron deficiency, and formed characteristic brownish regions in iron-deficient new leaves
    + OsbHLH059 knockdown lines also showed reduced expression of many iron deficiency-inducible genes
    + These results indicate that OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 positively regulate major iron deficiency responses in a similar but distinct manner, and that this function may be partially controlled by OsHRZs
