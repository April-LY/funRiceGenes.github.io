* **Key message**  
    + CAL1 is expressed preferentially in root exodermis and xylem parenchyma cells
    + We provide evidence that CAL1 acts by chelating Cd in the cytosol and facilitating Cd secretion to extracellular spaces, hence lowering cytosolic Cd concentration while driving long-distance Cd transport via xylem vessels
    + OsAFP1 exerted fungicidal activity against Candida albicans, the most common pathogenic fungus in humans, at 4<U+2009>¦ÌM concentration, but it did not inhibit the growth of human pathogenic bacteria
    + Immunohistochemistry showed that the OsAFP1 target molecule was located in the cell wall
    + Further, PI uptake and apoptosis assays suggested that OsAFP1 exerts its antifungal activity by inducing apoptosis of target cells
    + Partial peptides from rice defensin OsAFP1 exhibited antifungal activity against the rice blast pathogen Pyricularia oryzae.
    + In lipid-binding analyses performed using nitrocellulose membranes immobilized with various membrane lipid components, OsAFP1 was found to bind to phosphatidylinositols (PIPs) harboring phosphate groups, particularly PI(3)P

    + __CAL2__, __OsDEF7~CAL1~OsAFP1__, [Overexpression of a Defensin-Like Gene CAL2 Enhances Cadmium Accumulation in Plants.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of a Defensin-Like Gene CAL2 Enhances Cadmium Accumulation in Plants.%5BTitle%5D),  CAL2 shared 66% similarity with CAL1, and its mRNA accumulation is mainly observed in roots and is unaffected by Cd stress, but its transcription level was lower than that of CAL1 based on the relative expression of CAL2/Actin1 observed in this study and that reported previously
