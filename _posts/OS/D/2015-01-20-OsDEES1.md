* **Key message**  
    + A detailed investigation of the ovaries from OsDEES1 RNA interference plants indicated that the knockdown of OsDEES1 expression did not affect megasporogenesis but that it disturbed female gametophyte formation, resulting in a degenerated embryo sac and defective seed formation
    + OsDEES1 exhibited a tissue-specific expression pattern in flowers and seedlings
    + OsDEES1 silencing by RNA interference caused a high rate of female sterility
    + Crossing experiments showed that female reproductive organs lacking OsDEES1 carried a functional defect
