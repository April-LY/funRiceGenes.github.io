* **Key message**  
    + OsGEN-L-RNAi plants lacked mature pollen, resulting from a defect in early microspore development
    + Our results suggest that OsGEN-L plays an essential role in DNA metabolism required for early microspore development in rice
    + RNAi-mediated silencing of OsGEN-L (OsGEN-like), a new member of the RAD2/XPG nuclease family, causes male sterility by defect of microspore development in rice
    + Most of the OsGEN-L-RNAi plants displayed low fertility, and some of them were male-sterile
    + OsGEN-L has a 5'-flap endonuclease activity and plays an essential role in rice microspore development
    + A OsGEN-L-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was localized in the nucleus, and the OsGEN-L promoter was specifically active in the anthers
