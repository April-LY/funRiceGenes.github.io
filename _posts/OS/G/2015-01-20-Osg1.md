## Key message
1. __anther__, [Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a Novel β-1,3-Glucanase Gene from Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a Novel β-1,3-Glucanase Gene from Rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We isolated a cDNA for β-1,3-glucanase from rice anther and named it Oryza sativa glucanase 1 (Osg1)
2. __anther__, [Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a Novel β-1,3-Glucanase Gene from Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a Novel β-1,3-Glucanase Gene from Rice%5BTitle%5D)),  RT-PCR analysis revealed that Osg1 transcripts were present in leaves, roots, and anthers
3. __leaf__, [A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  Osg1 was found to be expressed throughout the plant and highly expressed in florets, leaf sheaths, and leaf blades
4. __sheath__, [A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  Osg1 was found to be expressed throughout the plant and highly expressed in florets, leaf sheaths, and leaf blades
5. __anther__, [A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  The pollen mother cells appeared to be normal in Osg1-RI plants, but callose degradation was disrupted around the microspores in the anther locules of the Osg1-RI plants at the early microspore stage
6. __root__, [Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a Novel β-1,3-Glucanase Gene from Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a Novel β-1,3-Glucanase Gene from Rice%5BTitle%5D)),  RT-PCR analysis revealed that Osg1 transcripts were present in leaves, roots, and anthers
7. __microspore__, [A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  Investigations using real-time PCR, immunocytochemical analysis, and a GUS-reporter gene driven by the Osg1 promoter indicated that Osg1 was mainly expressed at the late meiosis, early microspore, and middle microspore stages in the florets
8. __microspore__, [A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  The pollen mother cells appeared to be normal in Osg1-RI plants, but callose degradation was disrupted around the microspores in the anther locules of the Osg1-RI plants at the early microspore stage
9. __sterility__, [A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  The silencing of Osg1 resulted in male sterility
10. __pollen__, [A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  The pollen mother cells appeared to be normal in Osg1-RI plants, but callose degradation was disrupted around the microspores in the anther locules of the Osg1-RI plants at the early microspore stage
11. __pollen__, [A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development%5BTitle%5D)), A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development
12. __meiosis__, [A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  Investigations using real-time PCR, immunocytochemical analysis, and a GUS-reporter gene driven by the Osg1 promoter indicated that Osg1 was mainly expressed at the late meiosis, early microspore, and middle microspore stages in the florets
