* **Key message**  
    + Analysis of mRNA and the endogenous GAs reveal that biologically active GA level is increased by up-regulation of the OsGA20ox1 gene in B142
    + Within this mapped region, we identified the gene OsGA20ox1, which is related to gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis
    + Consistent with the dwarf phenotype of gd1, expression of the gibberelic acid (GA) inactivation gene OsGA2ox3 is increased dramatically, accompanied by reduced expression of GA biosynthetic genes including OsGA20ox1, OsGA20ox2 and OsGA3ox2 in gd1, resulting in a decreased endogenous GA(4) level
    + These results indicate that OsGA20ox1 is a strong candidate gene for major QTL controlling seedling vigor in rice
    + OsGA20ox1, a candidate gene for a major QTL controlling seedling vigor in rice
    + A role of OsGA20ox1 , encoding an isoform of gibberellin 20-oxidase, for regulation of plant stature in rice
