56. __cell elongation__, [ROOT GROWTH INHIBITING, a Rice Endo-1,4-β-d-Glucanase, Regulates Cell Wall Loosening and is Essential for Root Elongation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ROOT GROWTH INHIBITING, a Rice Endo-1,4-β-d-Glucanase, Regulates Cell Wall Loosening and is Essential for Root Elongation%5BTitle%5D)),  The rt mutant showed a severe defect in cell elongation at the root-elongating zone with additional collapse of epidermal and cortex cells at the root tip caused by the defect in the smooth exfoliation of root cap cells
57. __cell elongation__, [ROOT GROWTH INHIBITING, a Rice Endo-1,4-β-d-Glucanase, Regulates Cell Wall Loosening and is Essential for Root Elongation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ROOT GROWTH INHIBITING, a Rice Endo-1,4-β-d-Glucanase, Regulates Cell Wall Loosening and is Essential for Root Elongation%5BTitle%5D)),  Based on these results, we concluded that RT is involved in the disassembly of the cell wall for cell elongation in roots as well as for root cap exfoliation from the epidermal cell layer by hydrolyzing the noncrystalline amorphous cellulose fibers of cellulose microfibrils resulting in loosening of the hemicellulose and cellulose interaction
