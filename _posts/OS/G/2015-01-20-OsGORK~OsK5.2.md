* **Key message**  
    + OsGORK was expressed to some degree in most tissues, such as leaf blade, node, leaf sheath and root, but at high levels in flowers
    + Differential gene expression of two outward-rectifying shaker-like potassium channels OsSKOR and OsGORK in rice
    + A dual role for the OsK5.2 ion channel in stomatal movements and K+ loading into xylem sap.

* **Connection**  
    + __OsGORK~OsK5.2__, __OsNAC2~OsTIL1~OMTN2~OsORE1__, [OsNAC2 positively affects salt-induced cell death and binds to the OsAP37 and OsCOX11 promoters.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsNAC2 positively affects salt-induced cell death and binds to the OsAP37 and OsCOX11 promoters.%5BTitle%5D),  Furthermore, K+-efflux channels (OsGORK and OsSKOR) were obviously activated by OsNAC2
