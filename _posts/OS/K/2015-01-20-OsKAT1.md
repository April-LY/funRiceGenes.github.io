* **Key message**  
    + Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells
    + By the expression of OsKAT1, the K(+) contents of salt-stressed G19 cells increased during the exponential growth phase
    + These results suggest that OsKAT1 is involved in salt tolerance of rice in cooperation with other K(+) channels by participating in maintenance of cytosolic cation homeostasis during salt stress and thus protects cells from Na(+)
    + We found that expression of a cDNA clone, encoding the rice homolog of Shaker family K(+) channel KAT1 (OsKAT1), suppressed the salt-sensitive phenotype of yeast strain G19 (Deltaena1-4), which lacks a major component of Na(+) efflux
    + Rice cells overexpressing OsKAT1 also showed enhanced salt tolerance and increased cellular K(+) content
    + These functions of OsKAT1 are likely to be common among Shaker K(+) channels because OsAKT1 and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) KAT1 were able to complement the salt-sensitive phenotype of G19 as well as OsKAT1
