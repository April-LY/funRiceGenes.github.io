## Key message
1. __vegetative__, [Identification and characterization of OsEBS, a gene involved in enhanced plant biomass and spikelet number in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and characterization of OsEBS, a gene involved in enhanced plant biomass and spikelet number in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results showed that the increased size of vegetative organs in OsEBS-expressed plants was enormously caused by increasing cell number
2. __leaf__, [Identification and characterization of OsEBS, a gene involved in enhanced plant biomass and spikelet number in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and characterization of OsEBS, a gene involved in enhanced plant biomass and spikelet number in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We cloned and characterized qGP5-1 and confirmed that the newly identified gene OsEBS (enhancing biomass and spikelet number) increased plant height, leaf size and spikelet number per panicle, leading to an increase in total grain yield per plant
3. __height__, [Identification and characterization of OsEBS, a gene involved in enhanced plant biomass and spikelet number in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and characterization of OsEBS, a gene involved in enhanced plant biomass and spikelet number in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We cloned and characterized qGP5-1 and confirmed that the newly identified gene OsEBS (enhancing biomass and spikelet number) increased plant height, leaf size and spikelet number per panicle, leading to an increase in total grain yield per plant
