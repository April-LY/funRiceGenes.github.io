* **Key message**  
    + Collectively, our results indicate that rice OsCPK10 is a crucial regulator in plant immune responses, and that it may regulate disease resistance by activating both SA- and JA-dependent defense responses
    + Similarly, transgenic rice plants containing constitutively active OsCPK10 exhibited enhanced resistance to blast fungus M
