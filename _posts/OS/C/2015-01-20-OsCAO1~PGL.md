## Key message
1. __leaf__, [PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  This study characterizes a rice mutant, pale green leaf (pgl), and isolates the gene PGL by using a map-based cloning approach
2. __grain__, [PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Compared with wild-type plants, pgl exhibits a lower Chl content with a reduced and disorderly thylakoid ultrastructure, which decreases the photosynthesis rate and results in reduced grain yield and quality
3. __map-based cloning__, [PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  This study characterizes a rice mutant, pale green leaf (pgl), and isolates the gene PGL by using a map-based cloning approach
4. __photosynthesis__, [PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Compared with wild-type plants, pgl exhibits a lower Chl content with a reduced and disorderly thylakoid ultrastructure, which decreases the photosynthesis rate and results in reduced grain yield and quality
5. __grain yield__, [PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Compared with wild-type plants, pgl exhibits a lower Chl content with a reduced and disorderly thylakoid ultrastructure, which decreases the photosynthesis rate and results in reduced grain yield and quality
6. __yield__, [PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Compared with wild-type plants, pgl exhibits a lower Chl content with a reduced and disorderly thylakoid ultrastructure, which decreases the photosynthesis rate and results in reduced grain yield and quality
7. __stress__, [PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Moreover, pgl is sensitive to heat stress
8. __senescence__, [PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, pgl exhibits premature senescence in both natural and dark-induced conditions and more severe Chl degradation and reactive oxygen species accumulation than does the wild-type
9. __quality__, [PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Compared with wild-type plants, pgl exhibits a lower Chl content with a reduced and disorderly thylakoid ultrastructure, which decreases the photosynthesis rate and results in reduced grain yield and quality
10. __reactive oxygen species__, [PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, pgl exhibits premature senescence in both natural and dark-induced conditions and more severe Chl degradation and reactive oxygen species accumulation than does the wild-type

## Connection
1. __OsCAO1~PGL__, __OsCAO2__, [Differential regulation of chlorophyll a oxygenase genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential regulation of chlorophyll a oxygenase genes in rice%5BTitle%5D),  We have identified two genes (OsCAO1 and OsCAO2) from the rice genome that are highly homologous to previously studied chlorophyll a oxygenase (CAO) genes
2. __OsCAO1~PGL__, __OsCAO2__, [Differential regulation of chlorophyll a oxygenase genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differential regulation of chlorophyll a oxygenase genes in rice%5BTitle%5D),  These results suggest that OsCAO1 plays a major role in chlorophyll b biosynthesis, and that OsCAO2 may function in the dark
