* **Key message**  
    + This study characterizes a rice mutant, pale green leaf (pgl), and isolates the gene PGL by using a map-based cloning approach
    + Compared with wild-type plants, pgl exhibits a lower Chl content with a reduced and disorderly thylakoid ultrastructure, which decreases the photosynthesis rate and results in reduced grain yield and quality
    + Moreover, pgl is sensitive to heat stress
    + In addition, pgl exhibits premature senescence in both natural and dark-induced conditions and more severe Chl degradation and reactive oxygen species accumulation than does the wild-type

    + __OsCAO1~PGL__, __OsCAO2__, [Differential regulation of chlorophyll a oxygenase genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Differential regulation of chlorophyll a oxygenase genes in rice%5BTitle%5D), We have identified two genes (OsCAO1 and OsCAO2) from the rice genome that are highly homologous to previously studied chlorophyll a oxygenase (CAO) genes
    + __OsCAO1~PGL__, __OsCAO2__, [Differential regulation of chlorophyll a oxygenase genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Differential regulation of chlorophyll a oxygenase genes in rice%5BTitle%5D), These results suggest that OsCAO1 plays a major role in chlorophyll b biosynthesis, and that OsCAO2 may function in the dark
