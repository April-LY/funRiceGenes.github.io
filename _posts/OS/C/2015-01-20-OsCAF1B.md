* **Publication**  
    + [A CCR4 association factor 1, OsCAF1B, participates in the ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA polyA tail shortening and plays a role in germination and seedling growth.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A CCR4 association factor 1, OsCAF1B, participates in the ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA polyA tail shortening and plays a role in germination and seedling growth.%5BTitle%5D), 2019, Plant Cell Physiol.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Additionally, we found that overexpression of OsCAF1B retards seed germination and seedling growth
    + These findings indicate that OsCAF1B participates in sugar-induced ¦ÁAmy3 mRNA degradation and deadenylation, and acts a negative factor for germination and seedling development
