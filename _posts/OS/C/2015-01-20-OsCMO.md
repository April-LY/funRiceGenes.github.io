* **Publication**  
    + [Rice choline monooxygenase OsCMO protein functions in enhancing glycine betaine biosynthesis in transgenic tobacco but does not accumulate in rice Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice choline monooxygenase OsCMO protein functions in enhancing glycine betaine biosynthesis in transgenic tobacco but does not accumulate in rice Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica%5BTitle%5D), 2012, Plant Cell Rep.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Surprisingly, a large amount of truncated proteins derived from OsCMO was induced in the rice seedlings in response to salt stresses
    + Northern blot demonstrated the transcription of OsCMO is enhanced by salt stress
    + Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsCMO results in increased GB content and elevated tolerance to salt stress
    + KEY MESSAGE: Expression and transgenic studies demonstrate OsCMO is transcriptionally induced in response to salt stress and functions in increasing glycinebetaine accumulation and enhancing tolerance to salt stress
