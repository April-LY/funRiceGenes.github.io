## Key message
1. __leaf__, [Molecular cloning, functional expression and subcellular localization of two putative vacuolar voltage-gated chloride channels in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular cloning, functional expression and subcellular localization of two putative vacuolar voltage-gated chloride channels in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D),  OsCLC-1 was expressed in most tissues, whereas OsCLC-2 was expressed only in the roots, nodes, internodes and leaf sheaths
2. __root__, [Molecular cloning, functional expression and subcellular localization of two putative vacuolar voltage-gated chloride channels in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular cloning, functional expression and subcellular localization of two putative vacuolar voltage-gated chloride channels in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D),  OsCLC-1 was expressed in most tissues, whereas OsCLC-2 was expressed only in the roots, nodes, internodes and leaf sheaths
3. __sheath__, [Molecular cloning, functional expression and subcellular localization of two putative vacuolar voltage-gated chloride channels in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular cloning, functional expression and subcellular localization of two putative vacuolar voltage-gated chloride channels in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D),  OsCLC-1 was expressed in most tissues, whereas OsCLC-2 was expressed only in the roots, nodes, internodes and leaf sheaths

## Connection
1. __OsCLC-1__, __OsCLC-2__, [Molecular cloning, functional expression and subcellular localization of two putative vacuolar voltage-gated chloride channels in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular cloning, functional expression and subcellular localization of two putative vacuolar voltage-gated chloride channels in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D), We isolated two cDNA clones OsCLC-1 and OsCLC-2 homologous to tobacco CLC-Nt1, which encodes a voltage-gated chloride channel, from rice Oryza sativa L
2. __OsCLC-1__, __OsCLC-2__, [Molecular cloning, functional expression and subcellular localization of two putative vacuolar voltage-gated chloride channels in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular cloning, functional expression and subcellular localization of two putative vacuolar voltage-gated chloride channels in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D),  Southern blot analysis of the rice genomic DNA revealed that OsCLC-1 and OsCLC-2 were single-copy genes on chromosomes 4 and 2, respectively

5. __OsCLC-1__, __OsCLC-2__, [Molecular cloning, functional expression and subcellular localization of two putative vacuolar voltage-gated chloride channels in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Molecular cloning, functional expression and subcellular localization of two putative vacuolar voltage-gated chloride channels in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D),  Tagged synthetic green fluorescent protein which was fused to OsCLC-1 or OsCLC-2 localized in the vacuolar membranes
