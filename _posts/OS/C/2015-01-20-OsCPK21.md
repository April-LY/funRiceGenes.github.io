    + " These results suggest that OsCPK21 is involved in the positive regulation of the signaling pathways that are involved in the response to ABA and salt stress
    + Functional characterisation of OsCPK21, a calcium-dependent protein kinase that confers salt tolerance in rice"
    + The survival rate of the OsCPK21-FOX plants was higher than that of wild-type (WT) plants grown under high salinity conditions
    + Several ABA- and high salinity-inducible genes were more highly expressed in the OsCPK21-FOX plants than in WT plants
    + "Functional characterisation of OsCPK21, a calcium-dependent protein kinase that confers salt tolerance in rice"
    + The inhibition of seedling growth by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment was greater in the OsCPK21-FOX plants than in WT plants
    + These results suggest that OsCPK21 is involved in the positive regulation of the signaling pathways that are involved in the response to ABA and salt stress
