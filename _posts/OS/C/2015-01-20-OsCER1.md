* **Key message**  
    + OsCER1 was highly expressed in the tapetum (stage 10) and bicellular pollen cells (stage 11)
    + Downregulation of OsCER1 in rice led to sterility, and fewer amyloplasts within the mature pollen grains
    + Furthermore, significantly altered levels of expression of genes involved in the pollen development were exhibited in the OsCER1 knocked down plants
    + These results indicate that OsCER1 is critical for VLC alkanes biosynthesis, plastids differentiation, and pollen development
    + OsCER1 Plays a Pivotal Role in Very-Long-Chain Alkane Biosynthesis and Affects Plastid Development and Programmed Cell Death of Tapetum in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + In addition, the downregulation of OsCER1 in rice caused delayed tapetal programmed cell death and abnormal development of plastids in the tapetal cells
