* **Key message**  
    + These data suggest that OsCLP, which has chitinase activity, may play an important role in plant defenses against pathogens
    + In addition, exogenous treatment with OsCLP affected the growth of the basidiomycete fungus Rhizoctonia solani through degradation of the hyphal cell wall
