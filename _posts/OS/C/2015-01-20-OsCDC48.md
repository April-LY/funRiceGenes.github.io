* **Key message**  
    + OsCDC48 was expressed constitutively in the root, stem, leaf and panicle
    + Single base substitution in OsCDC48 is responsible for premature senescence and death phenotype in rice.
    + Our results indicated that the impaired function of OsCDC48 was responsible for the premature senescence and death phenotype

* **Connection**  
    + __OsCDC48__, __OsDER1__, [OsDER1 is an ER-associated protein degradation factor that responds to ER stress.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsDER1 is an ER-associated protein degradation factor that responds to ER stress.%5BTitle%5D),  Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that OsDER1 interacted with OsHRD1, OsHRD3, and OsCDC48, the essential components of the canonical ERAD pathway
