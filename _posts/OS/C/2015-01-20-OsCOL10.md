## Key message
1. __leaf__, [OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsCOL10 is affected by the circadian clock and preferentially expressed in leaf mesophyll cells; it is localized to the nucleus and has transcriptional activation activity
2. __nucleus__, [OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsCOL10 is affected by the circadian clock and preferentially expressed in leaf mesophyll cells; it is localized to the nucleus and has transcriptional activation activity
3. __flowering time__, [OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsCOL10 (driven by a strong promoter or by fusing it to the activation domain of VP64) showed delayed flowering time under both short and long days

## Connection
1. __Ehd1__, __OsCOL10__, [OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Further studies show that OsCOL10 represses the expression of the FT-like genes RFT1 and Hd3a through Ehd1
2. __Ehd1__, __OsCOL10__, [OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Together, we conclude that OsCOL10 functions as a flowering-time repressor that links between Ghd7 and Ehd1 in rice
3. __Ghd7__, __OsCOL10__, [OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.%5BTitle%5D)), OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.
4. __Ghd7__, __OsCOL10__, [OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Transcripts of OsCOL10 are more abundant in the plants carrying a functional Ghd7 allele or over-expressing Ghd7 than in the Ghd7-deficient ones, thus placing OsCOL10 downstream of Ghd7
5. __Ghd7__, __OsCOL10__, [OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Together, we conclude that OsCOL10 functions as a flowering-time repressor that links between Ghd7 and Ehd1 in rice
6. __Hd3a__, __OsCOL10__, [OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Further studies show that OsCOL10 represses the expression of the FT-like genes RFT1 and Hd3a through Ehd1
7. __OsCOL10__, __RFT1__, [OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-like gene, functions as a flowering-time repressor downstream of Ghd7 in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Further studies show that OsCOL10 represses the expression of the FT-like genes RFT1 and Hd3a through Ehd1
