1. __cell division__, [Isolation and initial characterization of GW5, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and initial characterization of GW5, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight%5BTitle%5D),  Together, our results suggest that GW5 represents a major QTL underlying rice width and weight, and that it likely acts in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to regulate cell division during seed development
2. __grain width__, [Isolation and initial characterization of GW5, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Isolation and initial characterization of GW5, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight%5BTitle%5D),  We earlier identified a major QTL that controls rice grain width and weight, GW5, which was mapped to a recombination hotspot on rice chromosome 5
