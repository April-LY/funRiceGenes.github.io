* **Key message**  
    + Here we clone and characterize GS3, an evolutionarily important gene controlling grain size in rice
    + We show that GS3 is highly expressed in young panicles in both short- and long-grained varieties but is not expressed in leaves or panicles after flowering, and we use genetic transformation to demonstrate that the dominant allele for short grain complements the long-grain phenotype
    + An association study revealed that a C to A mutation in the second exon of GS3 (A allele) was associated with enhanced grain length in Oryza sativa but was absent from other Oryza species
    + Evolutionary history of GS3, a gene conferring grain length in rice
    + We demonstrate that GS3, one of the genes regulating seed length, also regulates stigma length and participates in stigma exsertion in rice
    + Manipulation of GS3 should contribute to the improvement of hybrid seed-production efficiency
    + GS3 participates in stigma exsertion as well as seed length in rice
    + The GS3 locus located in the pericentromeric region of rice chromosome 3 has been frequently identified as a major QTL for both grain weight (a yield trait) and grain length (a quality trait) in the literature
    + GS3, a major QTL for grain length and weight and minor QTL for grain width and thickness in rice, encodes a putative transmembrane protein
    + GRAIN SIZE 3 (GS3) is a cloned gene that is related to seed length
    + Here we report the genetic and molecular characterization of GS3, a major quantitative trait locus for grain size
    + This study linked the functional domains of the GS3 protein to natural variation of grain size in rice
    + Linking differential domain functions of the GS3 protein to natural variation of grain size in rice
    + This study indicates a critical role for GS3 in defining the seed morphologies of modern subpopulations of O
    + Comparative sequencing of GS3, the most important grain length (GL) QTL, has shown that differentiation of rice GL might be principally due to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) between C and A in the second exon
    + A causal C-A mutation in the second exon of GS3 highly associated with rice grain length and validated as a functional marker
    + This mutation causes a 178-aa truncation in the C-terminus of the predicted protein, suggesting that GS3 may function as a negative regulator for grain size
    + Analysis of a random subpopulation of 201 individuals from the BC3F2 progeny confirmed that the GS3 locus explained 80-90% of the variation for grain weight and length in this population
    + Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants
    + Here we report the discovery of new deletion alleles at the GS3 locus, each of which confer short seed
    + Transformation experiments demonstrated that one of the deletion alleles of GS3 decrease the cell number in the upper epidermis of the glume, resulting in a significant reduction in seed length
    + Multiple and independent origins of short seeded alleles of GS3 in rice
    + Near isogenic lines of GS3 were developed by successive crossing and backcrossing Minghui 63 (large grain) with Chuan 7 (small grain), using Minghui 63 as the recurrent parent
    + Using 1,384 individuals with recessive phenotype (large grain) from a total of 5,740 BC3F2 plants and 11 molecular markers based on sequence information, GS3 was mapped to a DNA fragment approximately 7
    + Comparative sequencing analysis identified a nonsense mutation, shared among all the large-grain varieties tested in comparison with the small grain varieties, in the second exon of the putative GS3 gene
