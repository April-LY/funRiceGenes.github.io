3. __transcriptional regulator__, [A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a dominant QTL, GRAIN SIZE ON CHROMOSOME 2 (GS2), which encodes Growth-Regulating Factor 4 (OsGRF4), a transcriptional regulator.
4. __transcription activator__, [A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)), GS2 localizes to the nucleus and may act as a transcription activator.
5. __grain weight__, [A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The increase of GS2 expression leads to larger cells and increased numbers of cells, which thus enhances grain weight and yield.

11. __grain__, [Control of grain size and rice yield by GL2-mediated brassinosteroid responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of grain size and rice yield by GL2-mediated brassinosteroid responses%5BTitle%5D)),  Because of the mutation, GL2 has a moderately increased expression level, which consequently activates brassinosteroid responses by upregulating a large number of brassinosteroid-induced genes to promote grain development
12. __development__, [Control of grain size and rice yield by GL2-mediated brassinosteroid responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of grain size and rice yield by GL2-mediated brassinosteroid responses%5BTitle%5D)),  Because of the mutation, GL2 has a moderately increased expression level, which consequently activates brassinosteroid responses by upregulating a large number of brassinosteroid-induced genes to promote grain development
13. __brassinosteroid__, [Control of grain size and rice yield by GL2-mediated brassinosteroid responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of grain size and rice yield by GL2-mediated brassinosteroid responses%5BTitle%5D)),  Because of the mutation, GL2 has a moderately increased expression level, which consequently activates brassinosteroid responses by upregulating a large number of brassinosteroid-induced genes to promote grain development
14. __Brassinosteroid__, [Control of grain size and rice yield by GL2-mediated brassinosteroid responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of grain size and rice yield by GL2-mediated brassinosteroid responses%5BTitle%5D)),  Because of the mutation, GL2 has a moderately increased expression level, which consequently activates brassinosteroid responses by upregulating a large number of brassinosteroid-induced genes to promote grain development

## Connection
1. __GS2~OsGRF4~GL2__, __OSH71~Oskn2__, [Interaction between the GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR and KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX families of transcription factors.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Interaction between the GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR and KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX families of transcription factors.%5BTitle%5D)),  Conversely, RNA interference silencing of OsGRF3, OsGRF4, and OsGRF5 resulted in dwarfism, delayed growth and inflorescence formation, and up-regulation of Oskn2
2. __GS2~OsGRF4~GL2__, __GSK2__, [Control of grain size and rice yield by GL2-mediated brassinosteroid responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of grain size and rice yield by GL2-mediated brassinosteroid responses%5BTitle%5D)), Furthermore, we found that GSK2, the central negative regulator of rice brassinosteroid signalling, directly interacts with OsGRF4 and inhibits its transcription activation activity to mediate the specific regulation of grain length by the hormone.
