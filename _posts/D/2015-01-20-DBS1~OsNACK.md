## Publication
1.

## Key message
1. __root__, [The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development%5BTitle%5D)),  Relative to the severe defects in shoot and root growth, the overall structure of the dbs1 embryo was almost normal
2. __growth__, [The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development%5BTitle%5D)),  Relative to the severe defects in shoot and root growth, the overall structure of the dbs1 embryo was almost normal
3. __growth__, [The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development%5BTitle%5D)),  These observations suggest that DBS1 is involved in the growth and development of organs but not in organ initiation or organogenesis
4. __dwarf__, [The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report on one of the most severe dwarf mutants of rice, dwarf bamboo shoot 1 (dbs1)
5. __shoot__, [The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report on one of the most severe dwarf mutants of rice, dwarf bamboo shoot 1 (dbs1)
6. __shoot__, [The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development%5BTitle%5D)),  Relative to the severe defects in shoot and root growth, the overall structure of the dbs1 embryo was almost normal
