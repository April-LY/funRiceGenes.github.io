* **Key message**  
    + The pollen grains of dcm1 are proved to be defective in exine formation
    + Furthermore, peripheral callose surrounding the dcm1 pollen mother cells (PMCs) also disappeared untimely around pachytene
    + The zinc finger protein DCM1 is required for male meiotic cytokinesis by preserving callose in rice.
    + We demonstrated that meiotic cytokinesis defect in dcm1 is caused by prematurely dissolution of callosic plates
    + Together, we propose that DCM1 plays an essential role in male meiotic cytokinesis by preserving callose from prematurely dissolution in rice
