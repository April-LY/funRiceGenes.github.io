## Key message
1. __transcription factor__, [An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The DP1 enhancer SDP1 was also positional cloned, and was found identical to the recently reported RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1) gene encoding a TCP family transcription factor
2. __flower__, [An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice%5BTitle%5D),  We identified the DP1 gene by map-based cloning and found it encodes a nuclear-localized AT-hook DNA binding protein, suggesting a grass-specific role of chromatin architecture modification in flower development
3. __sterile__, [An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The sterile lemma at the palea side is occasionally elongated in dp1 mutants
4. __sterile__, [An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Both the sterile lemma elongation and the floral organ number increase phenotype are enhanced by the mutation of an independent gene SMALL DEGENERATIVE PALEA1 (SDP1), whose single mutation causes reduced palea size
5. __floral__, [An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice%5BTitle%5D),  In addition, we found a floral organ number increase in dp1 mutants at low penetration
6. __floral__, [An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice%5BTitle%5D),  Both the sterile lemma elongation and the floral organ number increase phenotype are enhanced by the mutation of an independent gene SMALL DEGENERATIVE PALEA1 (SDP1), whose single mutation causes reduced palea size
7. __floral__, [An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice%5BTitle%5D),  E function and presumable A function floral homeotic genes were found suppressed in the dp1-2 mutant
8. __lemma__, [An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The sterile lemma at the palea side is occasionally elongated in dp1 mutants

10. __architecture__, [An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice%5BTitle%5D),  We identified the DP1 gene by map-based cloning and found it encodes a nuclear-localized AT-hook DNA binding protein, suggesting a grass-specific role of chromatin architecture modification in flower development
11. __palea__, [An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The depressed palea1 (dp1) mutants show a primary defect in the main structure of palea, implying that palea is a fusion between the main structure and marginal tissues on both sides
12. __palea__, [An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The sterile lemma at the palea side is occasionally elongated in dp1 mutants

14. __palea__, [An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The DP1 enhancer SDP1 was also positional cloned, and was found identical to the recently reported RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1) gene encoding a TCP family transcription factor

## Connection
1. __DP1__, __REP1__, [An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice%5BTitle%5D),  The DP1 enhancer SDP1 was also positional cloned, and was found identical to the recently reported RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1) gene encoding a TCP family transcription factor
