## Expression information

## Key message
1. __cytokinin__, [Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression analysis showed that several type-A response regulator genes that act in the cytokinin (CK) signaling pathway were downregulated in the dec mutant
2. __cytokinin__, [Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway%5BTitle%5D)), Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway
3. __meristem__, [Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast to the SAM, the size of the root apical meristem (RAM) in dec was reduced, and cell division activity was suppressed
4. __seedling__, [Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, dec seedlings showed a reduced responsiveness to exogenous CK
5. __root__, [Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast to the SAM, the size of the root apical meristem (RAM) in dec was reduced, and cell division activity was suppressed
6. __root apical meristem__, [Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast to the SAM, the size of the root apical meristem (RAM) in dec was reduced, and cell division activity was suppressed
7. __cell division__, [Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway%5BTitle%5D)),  The dec mutants had an enlarged SAM with enhanced cell division activity
8. __cell division__, [Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast to the SAM, the size of the root apical meristem (RAM) in dec was reduced, and cell division activity was suppressed
