## Key message
1. __sterility__, [Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.%5BTitle%5D)),  Mutants defective in DTC1 exhibit phenotypes of an enlarged tapetum and middle layer with delayed degeneration, causing male sterility
2. __development__, [Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.%5BTitle%5D)),  Whereas wild-type plants accumulate large amounts of ROS in their anthers at Stage 9 of development, those levels remain low during all stages of development in dtc1 anthers
3. __transcription factor__, [Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that DTC1 functions downstream of those transcription factor genes and upstream of the genes encoding secretory proteins
4. __tapetum__, [Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.%5BTitle%5D)),  Mutants defective in DTC1 exhibit phenotypes of an enlarged tapetum and middle layer with delayed degeneration, causing male sterility
5. __tapetum__, [Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.%5BTitle%5D)),  These findings indicate that DTC1 is a key regulator for tapetum PCD by inhibiting ROS-scavenging activity
6. __PCD__, [Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.%5BTitle%5D)),  In dtc1 anthers, expression of genes encoding secretory proteases or lipid transporters is significantly reduced, while transcripts of PCD regulatory genes, e

8. __male sterility__, [Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.%5BTitle%5D)),  Mutants defective in DTC1 exhibit phenotypes of an enlarged tapetum and middle layer with delayed degeneration, causing male sterility

## Connection
1. __DTC1__, __DTD~EAT1__, [Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, levels of DTC1 transcripts are diminished in udt1, tdr, and eat1 anthers
