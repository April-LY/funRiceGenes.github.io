* **Key message**  
    + A phenotypic comparison of mutants expressing different amounts of DRUS1 and 2 revealed that reproductive growth requires a threshold level of DRUS1/2 proteins
    + DRUS1 and 2 maintain cell viability by repressing protease-mediated cell degradation and likely by affecting sugar utilization or conversion
    + We observed that both FLR1 and FLR2 were involved in tillering of rice, but at different levels
    + Interestingly, FLR1 and FLR2 showed different functions related to fertility, and FLR1 might be specifically involved in rice male gametophyte development
    + In this study, we generated flr1 and flr2 T-DNA insertion null mutants and investigated potential role of FLRs in rice yield
    + With these similar but different functions, we suggest that FLR1 and FLR2 might function in complementary ways to regulate the yield of rice
