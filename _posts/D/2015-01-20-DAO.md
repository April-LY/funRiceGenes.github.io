## Key message
1. __seed__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we demonstrate that the dioxygenase for auxin oxidation (DAO) gene, encoding a putative 2-oxoglutarate-dependent-Fe (II) dioxygenase, is essential for anther dehiscence, pollen fertility, and seed initiation in rice
2. __pollen__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we demonstrate that the dioxygenase for auxin oxidation (DAO) gene, encoding a putative 2-oxoglutarate-dependent-Fe (II) dioxygenase, is essential for anther dehiscence, pollen fertility, and seed initiation in rice
3. __auxin__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we demonstrate that the dioxygenase for auxin oxidation (DAO) gene, encoding a putative 2-oxoglutarate-dependent-Fe (II) dioxygenase, is essential for anther dehiscence, pollen fertility, and seed initiation in rice
4. __auxin__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, exogenous application of IAA or overexpression of the auxin biosynthesis gene OsYUCCA1 phenocopies the dao mutants
5. __auxin__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Collectively, these data support a key role of DAO in auxin catabolism and maintenance of auxin homeostasis central to plant reproductive development
6. __anther__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we demonstrate that the dioxygenase for auxin oxidation (DAO) gene, encoding a putative 2-oxoglutarate-dependent-Fe (II) dioxygenase, is essential for anther dehiscence, pollen fertility, and seed initiation in rice
7. __anther__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice mutant lines lacking a functional DAO display increased levels of free IAA in anthers and ovaries
8. __reproductive__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Collectively, these data support a key role of DAO in auxin catabolism and maintenance of auxin homeostasis central to plant reproductive development
9. __homeostasis__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Collectively, these data support a key role of DAO in auxin catabolism and maintenance of auxin homeostasis central to plant reproductive development
10. __iaa__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice mutant lines lacking a functional DAO display increased levels of free IAA in anthers and ovaries
11. __iaa__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, exogenous application of IAA or overexpression of the auxin biosynthesis gene OsYUCCA1 phenocopies the dao mutants
12. __iaa__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We show that recombinant DAO converts the active IAA into biologically inactive 2-oxoindole-3-acetic acid (OxIAA) in vitro
13. __fertility__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we demonstrate that the dioxygenase for auxin oxidation (DAO) gene, encoding a putative 2-oxoglutarate-dependent-Fe (II) dioxygenase, is essential for anther dehiscence, pollen fertility, and seed initiation in rice
